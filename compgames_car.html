<h2>Carmageddon TDR 2000</h2>
<p class="text">The third game in the Carmageddon series sees you take the wheel of the Eagle again but this time it's not all race madness. each level is split up into three driving missions where objectives must be met and three traditional racing missions. The driving missions are a welcome distraction some if the times but most of the time you find yourself wanting to simply race around the graphically improved stages. The shock value of the game has also gone because you know what to expect but if you've never played the original then it's a good introduction.</p>

<h2>Carmageddon</h2>
<p class="text">The original Carmageddon was released in 1997 and it was one of the original video game 'nasty'. It was based on a film called 'The Death Race 2000' and the aim is to win a car race by being first to cross the line, killing all other competitors or by killing every pedestrian on the course. I first played this game in my uncles house and was instantly hooked. It wasn't until I got my own PC that I played the game in it's entirety. So if your looking for a racing game with a bit more to it then this is the one for you.</p>
