<H3 align="center">College / Third Year (Diploma) / Subjects</H3>
<P align="center" class="main">Well third year was interesting. I think I did the least amount of work this year than in the two previous years. It was a miracle that I got such good results. To demonstrate how lazy I was this year: I never 100% completed a week and we missed our very first lecture of the year.<BR>All the same we had seven subjects.</P>
<hr>

<H4>Computer Systems Trends</H4>
<P>One of the more interesting if quite difficult subjects of third year. what made it different was the fact that it was 100% continuous assessment which meant loads of assignments but no christmas or final exam. This subject consisted of learning (or trying to learn) the basics of Java and a bit of ASP. There are some interesting assignments here including the bouncing java ball thing.
<UL>
    <LI>Bouncing Ball, JAVA</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H4>Data Communications and Networks</H4>
<P>A subject that was avoided quite often during the year, mainly because it was on a thursday and friday morning. Nothing too difficult about the subject even though I always got the subnetting question wrong, damn that one bit!!! anyway only two assignments, one of which was a group assignment (what a disaster that was) with a lot of practical things in-between like creating patch cables.</P>

<H4>Project</H4>
<P>The project was the same principal as the one last year, create some system that could be used in the real world or you had the option of creating a game. We had to use Object-Oriented C++ to create the project. I chose to create a Space Invaders game.
<!--<UL>

</P>

<H4>Relational Database Technology</H4>
<P>This subject was mainly concerned with learning how to use SQL and Oracle. It was a difficult subject in that there was a lot to learn and it was also skipped more than once during the year which increased the problems of revising. Thankfully the assignments weren't too difficult because we got a lot of help!!!</P>

<H4>Software Design</H4>
<P>This was the most difficult year of Software Design to date. Not only did we have to learn a new language, C++ which is a big difference to C despite what people say, but we had to use a new approach to software design ie Object Oriented design over sequential design. Just a few assignments here.

<H4>Systems Development</H4>
<P>One of the more boring subjects of third year. Its basically a subject all about how to create systems and the different techniques used in designing software (like we haven't been told most of it already!) There was also something in here about project management but to be honest I fell asleep so...</P>

<H4>UNIX</H4>
<P>Has to be the most difficult subject in the whole of third year. Not only do we have to learn UNIX comands but we also had to learn how to become system administrators which is something I don't think I'll ever be able to do, especially with UNIX. On top of all that there were a few difficult assignments in the middle of all that. Lets just say I was glad when this subject was over.</P>
