<h1>What Happened During The Break</h1>
<hr>
<p class="text">During the dates of 06/09/2005 and 29/04/2006 there was a big gap in the Blog section of the site. This was because if two reasons. The first was my computer went bust and it took me a long time to get it fixed and the other reason was that I was too lazy to update at the time that I did have my computer. So to make up for it I'll try to put as much as I can remember onto this page. It may not be in order and it may not make much sense but here it goes.</p>
