<h1>Final Graduation</h1>
<hr>
<p class="text">This is it. Final Graduation. After this I'll officially be a student no more. Our graduation was on Friday 11th of October 2004 at 1 PM and it took place in the multi-purpose hall (An D&aacute;nlann) of Letterkenny I.T. Of course that was the official engagement, the graduation actually lasted the whole weekend (and for some it went on even more than that). For me it all started on Thursday afternoon when I made that long trip up to Letterkenny again.</p>
<p class="text">I had decided early on to stay up in Letterkenny because there was no way I would be going home on Friday. So I booked myself into a B &amp; B for the weekend (all at the last minute of course). Although it didn't include the breakfast I got a good price for it (thankfully). </p>
