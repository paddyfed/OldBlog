<h1>Computer Games</h1>
<hr>
<p class="text">My first love I guess is computer games. The only reason I ever went on a PC was to play the original Command &amp; Conquer at my Uncle's house. Every time that I'd go up there it was straight on to the computer to play that game. At first it didn't even have sound, I suppose that was because there was no sound card or an incompatible one which was likely in those days. And when we got our own PC what game did I nick off him first? Yep you guessed it. Now I've sort of branched out. Although Star Wars games are still the main games that I go for I still keep an interest in Command &amp; Conquer, the Championship Manager series, point &amp; click adventures and sports games..</p>
