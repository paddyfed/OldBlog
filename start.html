<H3 align="center">PaddyFedoo Online:<BR>MISSION STATEMENT</H3>
<P align="center" class="main">Welcome to my place on the web! I intend to use this website to showcase my talents both as a HTML writer and as a C programmer. Along with any other things I put my mind to :). I also intend to use the site to keep in touch with my friends in college, at home and on the internet. Please e-mail me if you get a chance [ <A HREF="#">p****@****.ie</A> ]</P>
<HR>

<H3 align="center">Message of the Week</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" class="main">I've been having great difficulties trying to come up with a new design for the site. I want to create a good looking site with many new sections and features that describes a little bit more about me and my interests. It's the actual design that has me stumped though. I've been trying out a few ideas in Paint Shop Pro but there's nothing that I'm happy with. That's why it hasn't been changed yet and why I'm updating now. At least when I get the design finalised I'll have less to do plus I won't forget about things. I'll also be moving to a new server when I finish the design. It'll be on paddyfedoo.anyxhost.com. They don't have any pop-ups or advertising and they give a lot more things like PHP and MySql which is cool.
<br><br>Things that I want to add to the site:
<ul><li>
More movie reviews (each movie will be pt on its own page)</li>
<li>More sport with running commentary on the season (likewise on different pages)</li>
<li>More Star Wars (especially after the announcement of Revenge of the Sith)</li>
<li>TV reviews</li>
<li>Finish up the college section</li>
<li>Etc, etc, etcï¿½.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<p>53 days left until The Star Wars Trilogy DVD
<br>292 days left until Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
