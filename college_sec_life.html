<H3 align="center">College / Second Year (Certificate) / College Life</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" class="main">Being in Rented accommodation this year meant fewer restrictions in some areas (and more in others). However having a house of your own without anybody sticking their nose in (most of the time) was a great asset and very relaxing. This is what we did in our spare time.</P>
<hr>
<H4>Staying at Home</H4>
<P>As you can imagine, because I lived only a short distance from the college I usually went back to the house between classes and when I wasn't doing anything else. Main activities at home were watching TV (especially Cheers and Spin City), playing the PlayStation (too much Medal of Honour) and just generally chilling out by listening to music. Later on when the weather got good we'd sometimes play football in the garden or 'Walle'. Most of the time though was spent sitting on uncomfortable chairs, trying to avoid the shifty Landlord and chatting about Betty.</P>
<H4>Going Down Town</H4>
<P>Sometimes when boredom set in we just had to get up and go down town. Even though we rarely bought anything we just had to do something different for a few hours. Of course if we went down the town that was an assured way of making it rain on the way back up the hill. It usually did the trick, however. We were always marginally less bored when we got back than when we left.</P>
<H4>Sports</H4>
<P>Not a very regular occurence was the sporting endeavors of 20 Ashlawn. Although we did go to the Astro Turf pitches once which was a good night if a little exhausting. Also while studying for the Summer exams we went to the Pitch & Putt course for a quick 18. Also there were the numerous 'piggy in the middle' events, passing a football between the group.</P>
<H4>On the Computers/In the Canteen</H4>
<P>I didn't spend as much time in the college out of class time this year, mainly because of the house. However the 10.30 break in the Coffee Dock or Canteen was always a good time to catch up on the past weeks events and to look forward to the next night out. Also the Internet wasn't used as much during breaks. With more practical time in the labs I did all the surfing I wanted to do and only rarely went to the labs.</P>
