<H3 align="center">College / Fourth Year (Degree) / Nightlife</H3>
<P align="center" class="main">Fourth year was a chance to let my hair down. I'd done the whole studying thing in first year, the going out the odd time in second year and the wasting money and having to buy cheap food in third year. As you can imagine I wen't a bit crazy at the start but still pulled it together at the end. This is the story of the Fourth and final year, in Letterkenny.</P>
<hr>
<p>Fourth year at last and it started out like all the others with the usual Sunday and Thursday nights out. a new look upstairs in the Orchard sometimes got the nod on a Wednesday. Instead of boozing in bars the normal situation would be to get a carryout and drank in the house in Ashlawn where most nights we played FIFA (Magic), Rugby 2003 and watched the Bo'Selecta series 2 DVD. Good nights all of them. Then it was down to the Oasis (not before jumping the wall) and on to the Pulse.</p>
<p>This was the routine up until Halloween. I'd always wanted to dress up for Halloween night in the Pulse and this year I got my chance. I got doctors scrubs and a cheap kiddie's doctor set and went out writing prescriptions and generally diagnosing everyone. And in a rare moment of peace, Saddam Hussein and George Bush were seen enjoying the atmosphere.</p>
<p>For Christmas CP4 went on another mystery tour. This time we took the long trek to Monahan. We all met up in the Brewery where we got our coach. We landed in the 'Crazy Camel' which was one of Monaghan's newest bars at the time. Unfortunately because it was a Thursday night there was nobody else in the pub. I still had a good night because I actually knew the two barmen so I was able to chat to them and get served easily all night. I didn't go back to Letterkenny as I didn't see the point but I really did have a good night.</p>
<p>After Christmas it was straight into graduation time. Again our graduation was on Friday morning, again I went out the night before and again I was sick as a dog. The whole ceremony was an exercise on how not to get sick! That night we went to Letterkennys newest nightclub Milan. Although I had a bit of a strange night it's still a cool place. That night I stayed with my good friend Ultan and the next day met up with the guys for a Mr Chippie. That weekend I stayed in Devaney's house for a bit of craic.</p>
<p>Rag week was from the 9th till the 12th of February and for once I managed to go out every night. Sunday night was the Grill as usual, Monday night was the Pulse, Tuesday was Sister Saras and this was the only night that I didn't bring my camera. Wednesday night was the Orchard and Thursday was back in Saras and the Pulse. Loadsa craic and loadsa pictures, maybe someday I'll share them ;)</p>
<p>Paddy's day was spent in Gallagher's and we started early enough. Although we missed the parade nobody was really bothered and we got to watch Celtic play while worrying about the upcoming Barcelona matches. After a good few hours in Gallagher's we made our way down to the Cavern where we met up with Devaney.</p>
<p>After this it was time to get a bit serious. I stopped going out during the week because I had loads of projects to do as well as most of my main project. Sunday nights were still a necessity. These nights mostly consisted of getting off the bus, going to the Cottage for a pint or two, going to the Cavern for a Vodka/Jack Daniels/Anything or four and finally on to Bella's in the Grill until two or three in the morning. These were some of the best nights out. no hassles, no worries, good company and plenty of drink.</p>
<p>I didn't go out at all over Easter because I decided to stay in Letterkenny for the three weeks or so (which I don't usually do because I work in Monaghan) to do my project which was in danger of never being completed. Thankfully the time was not wasted and I finished it with not much time to spare. This included a bit of a hash of a write-up but at least it was out of the way.</p>
<p>After the main project was finished the majority of people went out to celebrate that Thursday night. Again it was the Pulse but it was a great night that I can't remember too much about. I do remember a great sense of relief off of everyone in CP4 though. A week later everyone had finished everything and we went out to celebrate again. There was nothing standing between us and our final exams now.</p>
<p>The exams were understandably barren and it was difficult to study for them. We did have a bit of a break in the middle of them though. on the Thursday before our last exam many other courses finished up. This was then the perfect chance to let our hair down before the last exam. we did a bit of a pub crawl around the town taking in the Oasis, the Cavern and Saras before settling in the Pulse. The next day we went out again this time to the Grill where I again took many, many photos.</p>
<p>Monday was finally our last exam and it was met with not much enthusiasm. I've been more relieved and excited about finishing Christmas exams. The general consensus was 'Is that it? It doesn't feel right'. Ah well, we soon forgot all about what we'd learned in college and got down to some drinking. We made our way to CP4's usual party ground which was the Central. The new beer garden was a new twist on a familiar theme. Thankfully it was mostly a good day. That night we made our way upstairs for more of the same. This was my last night out as a student in Letterkenny. It was a strange place to end it but still a great night.</p>
<p>The next day Dec had a barbecue organised at his house which was a nice touch. It was a really cool day and Dec managed not to poison us with his cooking. A few burgers, a few beers and a volleyball game later Dave got on the decks in the garage and played a few tunes for the rest of the night. It was a perfect way to end the year. The next day I packed up all my stuff and left Letterkenny as a student of LYIT. I still don't think it's sunk in yet that I'm not going back to college...roll on graduation in November.</p>
