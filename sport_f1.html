<p class="text"><b>Round 14: Turkey</b><br>Raikkonen cements his position as the fastest driver this year with another commanding win in the first Turkish GP. Alonso remains first in the drivers championship with a second place finish while Montoya finished in third.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 13: Hungary</b><br>Raikkonen again has the pace of the field as he wins in Hungary. Michael Schumacher finishes second while his brother Ralf finishes in third.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 12: Germany</b><br>Alonso takes a commanding lead in the drivers championship by claiming first place. Montoya finishes in second while Jenson Button has his first official podium of the season in third.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 11: Britain</b><br>Montoya completes his first win of the season and the first win for McLaren. Alonso stays ahead of the pack by finishing in second while his world championship rival Raikkonen finishes third.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 10: France</b><br>Alonso continues his great form with another win. Raikkonen has a brilliant drive to finish second while Michael Schumacher completes the podium.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 9: U.S.A.</b><br>A ridiculous race was won by Schumacher who lead home a Ferrari one-two. Monteiro's Jordan finished third becoming the first Portuguese driver to finish on the podium. All the teams running Michelin tyres retired after the parade lap due to safety issues.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 8: Canada</b><br>Raikkonen's McLaren couldn't be caught this weekend as Alonso flew into the barriers. Schumacher records his highest finish of the season in second while his Ferrari teammate Barrichello again finishes third.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 7: Europe</b><br>Alonso got back to winning ways at the Nurburgring. Heidfeld again comes second in the Williams while Barrichello's Ferrari completes the podium.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 6: Monaco</b><br>Raikkonen in the McLaren leads the two Williams of Heidfeld and Webber across the line to start his charge on the drivers championship.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 5: Spain</b><br>Kimi Raikkonen leads from start to finish in Spain. Championship leader Alonso finishes second with the Toyota driver Trulli finishing third. Schumacher retired after 58 laps due to tyre punctures.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">The BAR team have been disqualified for the next two races (Spain and Monaco) and have had their points from San Marino taken away. This was due to a light car that Button was running during the race.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 4: San Marino</b><br>Alonso claims his third win on the trot with a thrilling race against Michael Schumacher. For the last 12 laps he managed to hold off Schumachers challenge in the closest race that I've seen in a long time. Jenson Button finished third for BAR.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 3: Bahrain</b><br>Alonso is looking like the new Schumacher with his second win on the trot for Renault. Trulli again finished second and Raikkonen finished in third. Schumacher didn't finish after going off with a mechanical failure on lap 12.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 2: Malaysia</b><br>Fernando Alonso recorded his second ever win in Malaysia to go top of the drivers championship. Trulli came second for Toyota and Heidfeld came third for Williams. Michael Schumacher scored his first points of the season with a 7th place finish.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Round 1: Australia</b><br>A disappointing start for Michael Schumacher who went off after 40 laps. He didn't really look like scoring though. A great drive for Barrichello to get up into second but an even better drive for Alonso to get to third. Nobody could reach Fisichella for the win though and it was thoroughly deserved.</p>
