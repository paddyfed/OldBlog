<h1>College</h1>
<hr>
<p class="text">College was cool. I would highly recommend going to college to all school leavers. Especially Letterkenny, It's such a cool town with great nights out and it's very laid back, in four years going out I never had one problem with people wanting rows or anything. It goes without saying then that I would do it all over again given the chance. Plus, things seem to be really improving there. The town's getting bigger, the college has more facilities and the nightlife should be better than ever with five different nightclubs/large pubs vying for your business. But now it's all over for me. I just have graduation to look forward to in October. Groovy.<br>This section is split up into four parts with each year getting its own section.</p>
