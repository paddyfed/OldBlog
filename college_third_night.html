<H3 align="center">College / Third Year (Diploma) / Nightlife</H3>
<P align="center" class="main">The big difference between third year and second year was the fact that all the new faces in Letterkenny were getting younger, however not much changed with the nightlife aspect of things.</P>
<hr>
<P>With the start of college one thing was certain, this was going to be the year in which I really went mad. Of course that really didn't happen because I didn't have the money to but I certainly had a good go. In the whole of third year I missed a handful of Thursday nights and even less Sunday nights out. The basic Sunday night out was get off the bus, go to the flat to leave stuff off, go down to the Oasis to listen to Paul Ward and then on to Bellas in the Grill for a free night in. For a Thursday night it wasn't much different, except we couldn't go to Paul Ward, Karaoke instead, and it was the Pulse where everyone ended up.</P>
<P>This was the format up until Halloween when there was a fancy dress party in the Pulse. Loads of cool costumes were evident as well as a competition for the best dressed person. I, unfortunately, didn't have a costume to put on but I had fun looking at everyone else.</P>
<P>Come November I still hadn't missed a Sunday or Thursday night so I was well prepared for the craziest weekend of the year. It was November 14th and everyone was going out to the Pulse because some people had graduated that day. Not only was it a cool night out but I had other reasons to celebrate because on the 15th it was my turn for graduation. Of course I got so drunk the night before I slept in and if it weren't for Stan would have missed it completely. Graduation went well but I was looking forward to Devaney's 21st birthday which was that night. After listening to Paul Ward for about 4 hours we took an excursion across a golf course to try and get a flag but to no avail, finally settling down in Devaney's for the night. The next day, after a big fry up, we went into Bonnars pub and sat there until it was time to go to Letterkenny for a traditional Grill Saturday night out. After spending the night in Bird's house we left for the pub, again after going to Galfee's for a fry up. We eventually wound up in the Oasis for Paul Ward and into Bellas to finish the night.</P>
<P>After that things continued as usual. I only missed the Pulse on Thursday 21st of November and the Grill on Sunday 15th of December. The CP3 Christmas party took place in the Central again, which was a pretty cool night out and there is a photo taken from that night which I am completely innocent of any wrong doing, I plead ignorance. Just ask Sonya McNally, I didn't do anything to the dress!</P>
<P>Rag Week was between the 10th and 13th of February with the usual old things. There did seem to be less participation from pubs around the town and most activity occurred around the Pulse. Nevertheless there was the traditional stripper event on the Thursday night. However I think that most people were interested in the Ireland match that was on the same day.</P>
<P>Another class night out was the time of Grace's birthday. It all started off with a night out in the Pulse where we met up with Grace. She invited us all up to her house where she had a DJ playing and plenty of drink. It was defiantly the best house party I was at in Letterkenny and went on for ages with such classic tunes as 'Jump Around' and 'Put 'em Under Pressure' blaring from the kitchen. The night ended with some 'jackass' like antics with ironing board and chair sledging down the stairs. We didn't leave that party till early in the morning.</P>
<P>CP3 had two more class parties for third year. The first took place in the Orchard which was a very drunken night out for most people and which coincided with Kieran Supple's 21st birthday. That night ended in the Pulse with everyone in great spirits.</P>
<P>The night Celtic was playing in the UEFA cup final was a very strange night out for me. It was on the 21st of May and everyone was really excited about the match. We met up in the Cavern about an hour before kick-off and had a drink. However the drink wasn't agreeing with me so I decided to stop. This was about half an hour into the match. For the whole time my stomach was doing summersaults and it was all I could do to stop from throwing up. When the match finished I went straight home, not before throwing up three times along the street. I later went off the drink for a few weeks.</P>
<P>This self imposed 'pioneerism' was still in effect when the last CP3 class party took place. It was on the Friday straight after the exams had finished. It started in the cottage for a few and then moved onto McGinley's where there was a drinks promotion for the students of CP3. We then moved onto Gallagher's to listen to a singer who was a friend of Aidan McGuirk's. A few were more interested in the hen party that was taking place next door :). The night finished in the Orchard, which was absolutely packed. This was a great night to finish off the year, especially after all the stress people went through for the exams and throughout the year. We all hoped we'd be back for the craic of our final year in Letterkenny.</P>
