<h1>Second Year Nightlife</h1>
<hr>
<p class="text">With Second Year, as you can imagine, it was a lot easier to get into a routine and much easier to get started and actually know what was going on. Some things would never change though, Thursday nights were still the best nights out.<br>This is the story of Second Year.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">The start of Second Year brought many new faces to Letterkenny and the realisation that others wouldn't be returning. However Thursday nights were still the same, the big story being the newly refurbished, and highly improved, upstairs in the Pulse. More space and better lighting improved the atmosphere considerably.</p>
<p class="text">By now it was clear that the Globe wasn't fulfilling a role as a good regular pub. The price of beer went up but the quality didn't. The result was a bit of experimentation with other bars in the area. The Oasis bar was now the venue of choice followed by the Pusle every Thursday.</p>

<p class="text">The Grill also had a few good nights in the run up to Christmas. Mauro Picotto was the first major DJ to entertain. This night was the only night that all of the lads from 20 Ashlawn went out. It was truly an excellent night out. Judge Jules also came back soon after this but it wasn't the big event like last year. Also around this time was the Halloween costume party in the Pulse with such guests as Brittney Spears, 4 afro guys and Mother Teresa.</p>
<p class="text">After the last exam at Christmas, CP2 had a small get-together in the Brewery. But the proper Christmas party didn't come until January with the CP2 'Mystery Tour'. After a lot of speculation the bus landed in Kilmacrenan. Even though the venue didn't seem exotic or all that mysterious everyone who went had a great, and drunken, time.</p>
<p class="text">Another great night worth noting was Marcella McGovern's Birthday party. It all started with a session in her house, complete with DJ and decks. We all moved to the Pulse until that finished. It was then back to Marcy's house before heading home, quite drunk, in the snow. An absolutely classic night and one which will not be forgotten in a hurry.</p>
<p class="text">Rag Week 2002 (11/2/2002 - 17/2/2002) was another classic. Monday night was probably the most interesting night with the School Disco and 'Find Your Partner' event. Yes I donned the old SEM uniform and I found my partner. (I was 'son' and I had to find 'Steptoe'). Thursday night was again packed but it was easier to move around. Sunday nights was also a new time to go out with the opening of Bella's in the Grill. Even though the music wasn't great the free entrance wasn't to be passed up.</p>
<p class="text">The Revs came to the Orchard on the 2nd of May and I, of course, had tickets for me and my sister. Not only that but it was Ultan's Birthday celebrations. The night started in the Oasis and moved on to the Orchard for an excellent concert. The night concluded in the Pulse (again) and much beer was taken.</p>
<p class="text">The last week of the Summer exams was the final chance to go out before the Summer break. CP2 finished on Tuesday and immediately went to the Cottage to celebrate/drown sorrows. We then moved on to the Central for much needed food and Karaoke. Finally we all made our way to the Pulse. However Thursday night was still the night to be out and with most people finished their exams it was truly the night to celebrate. Then it was all over for another year, hopefully we'd all be back for more of the same next year :)</p>
