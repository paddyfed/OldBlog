<h1>First Year Subjects</h1>
<hr>
<p class="text">First Year in college was a very enjoyable experience. I took to the college and the course well and I made many new friends during the year, not to mention meeting up with a few old ones. There were six subjects in First Year.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p class="text">Probably the hardest subject in first year. Imagine learning English without any novels or poetry. Letters, memos, grammar, spelling, everything was thrown into this subject. Lecturer Martin Robinson kept a tight ship though and there wasn't too much work to be done, just a few assignments.
</P>

<h2>Computer Systems/Data Communications</h2>
<p class="text">One subject split into two. A lot of learning went on, especially in Computer Systems. No assignments in this subject although we did get to make interesting things, e.g. UTP Patch Cable, RS232 cables, in Data Communications. Very interesting especially for myself, James and Solderin' Charlie :)</P>

<h2>Information Systems</h2>
<p class="text">The most information intensive subject of them all. Packed full of things about databases, teleworking, computer crime (a popular subject) and the internet. Required a lot of study and effort. A few assignments were required here.
</P>

<h2>Maths</h2>
<p class="text">Maths was what you'd expect, Maths. It had all the usual maths subjects, but with a computer twist, and a few new ones like Binary and Hex. Microsoft's Excel gave us something different to do as well as problem sheets throughout the year.</P>

<h2>Problem Solving</h2>
<p class="text">Well what can be said about Problem Solving? While it was very useful for reinforcing our maths, programming and algorithm designing, it has to be said that lecturer Donat Desmond was one of the more unusual ones. However, I can't say anything bad about the guy. He also gave us one of the more interesting assignments, a program that tells the user what type of triangle they made.</P>

<h2>Software Design</h2>
<p class="text">Probably the most important subject in the whole course. Weekly practical's taught us the basic principles of software design and C programming. We also had a few assignments throughout the year. The final assignment (assignment 3) was the biggest program we have had to write so far.</P>
