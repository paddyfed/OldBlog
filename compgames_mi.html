<h1>Monkey Island</h1>

<h2>Escape from Monkey Island</h2>
<p class="text">The fourth game in the series takes a small departure from the norm. The game is now completly 3D using the graphics engine developed for Grim Fandango and you move the character like you would in a platform game, using the keys. Again we continue the story of Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley. I don't think the jokes are as funny as the previous game, the controls are difficult to get used to and some of the puzzles can be tricky but it's still a good game to complete. I just wish they had stayed with the point and click controls.</p>

<h2>The Curse of Monkey Island</h2>
<p class="text">This is the first Monkey Island game that I've played although It's the third in the series. Basically it follows the story of one Guybrush Threepwood as he tries to woo Governor Elaine Marley while escaping from the undead pirate LeChuck. It's a point and click adventure game but unlike the first two games it actually has some good cartoon like graphics. The controls are easy to use and some of the puzzles are challenging. the only thing I did wrong with this game was to play it on easy first because it sort of ruins the harder version of the game. Still its a great and funny introduction to adventure games.</p>
