<H3 align="center">College / Fourth Year (Degree) / College Life</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" class="main">We didn't really have much free time this year but we still managed to have a bit of fun outside college and outside the pub. This was the mustard to the filling of the sandwich that was fourth year (how's that for a metaphor!!)</P>
<hr>
<H4>Astroturf</H4>
<P>The Pin Tavern has a number of Astroturf pitches and most weeks (especially after Christmas) we would go down for a game. Usually five a side we had some good craic here. After a few weeks we were even able to run around without getting totally killed from the exercise. The teams were made up of me, Stan, Deirmuid the Greyhound, Gary, Kieran, Doc, Colin, Enda and anyone else we could rope into it.</P>
<H4>Chilling/Messing in the Flat</H4>
<P>The flat was where we were most of the times. There wasn't much to do only watch the TV and watch episodes of South Park and the Simpsons that I downloaded from the net in college. The biggest activity we did in the flat was the messing that went on which included putting barbecue sauce on light switches and door handles, throwing popcorn about, pileups and kicking the football about (without actually managing to break anything). The funniest bit of messing was throwing stuff at the construction site next door which included half a fudge cake, eggs and a few things that smashed!!</P>
<H4>Cinema</H4>
<P>The Cinema was attended a few times during the year which included Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, The Matrix Revolutions and Dawn of the Dead among others. Most weeks Stan would get a video out as well.</P>
<H4>PlayStation 2</H4>
<P>The PlayStation 2 came up for a visit after Christmas and we had a good many games of Tiger Woods 2004, CTR, FIFA and Red Faction which Diarmuid never managed to win even though he got the game out.
