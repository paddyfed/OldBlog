<h2>Command &amp; Conquer</h2>

<h4>Command &amp; Conquer: RED ALERT 2</h4>
<p class="text">Probably the best Command &amp; Conquer game out of this lot. The unit allocation and balance is near perfect. For every tank or unit in one camp, the other camp has a unit that can kill it. This is really noticeable in the skirmish matches and the later levels can be extremely difficult but rewarding when finally completed (after numerous attempts I must add). The story starts off with the Soviets invading America and you have to either help or hinder their efforts depending on which side you fight for. I honestly can't find much wrong with this game and I still play it months after completing it.</p>

<h4>Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun</h4>
<p class="text">This is the third game in the series and we return to the NOD vs GDI scenario when Kane, the leader of the NOD forces, turns up alive. The thing I like about this game is, not only the good looking graphics, but the great game play and the variety of the missions. It isn't always about killing the other side. In one mission you have to defend a fallen spacecraft from NOD during an ion storm which basically knocks out your radar, very tense stuff. The unit balance isn't as good as RED ALERT 2, I think GDI is too powerful with too many options, but it is still a good game and incidentally it's the first Command &amp; Conquer game that I bought.</p>

<h4>Command &amp; Conquer: RED ALERT</h4>
<p class="text">In a bit of a departure from the original Command &amp; Conquer series the RED ALERT story concentrates on what might have happened if Hitler never existed. The Soviets rose up and attempted to overtake Europe, Thankfully the Allied forces are here to push them back. Although the graphics are slightly improved in this game the biggest change is the addition of naval units to your arsenal. The notion of super weapons also makes a bigger impact. The Allies have their Chronosphere and the Soviets use their Iron Curtain to tip the balance. This idea that both sides have super weapons is used and expanded in all Command &amp; Conquer games.</p>

<h4>Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Dawn</h4>
<p class="text">Tiberian Dawn is the name given to the original Command &amp; Conquer game that appeared on the PC. This is the grandaddy of all RTS games and it is still one of the best. The graphics have aged considerably, especially in the old DOS version, but the game play hasn't. Here you have the original Mammoth Tank, the ORCA fighter, the Stealth Tank, cool Harvesters that actually look like they're harvesting, the Obelisk of Light and the really cool looking Temple of NOD. For nostalgia's sake I'd recommend this game to anyone, that's if you haven't already played it.</p>
