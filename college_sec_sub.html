<H3 align="center">College / Second Year (Certificate) / Subjects</H3>
<P align="center" class="main">Second year went very well for me. A lot of hard work was done and some slacking off was evident later on in the year. Perhaps with a more consistent work rate my exam results would've been better however I can't complain.<BR>In second year we had seven subjects.</P>
<hr>

<H4>Computer Architecture/Operating Systems (CAOS)</H4>
<P>CAOS was one of those subjects that no one was ever 100% sure about. Tommy Devine, while one of the soundest lecturer that you'll ever meet, was very strict when marking exams and often quizzed us in class. During the lectures, however, there was no writing and this was a subject that was avoided especially after Christmas.

</P>

<H4>Database Technology</H4>
<P>Database was just that. All about Databases, data modeling, primary keys, foreign keys and normalisation. With only one lecture a week this was a subject that was easy enough to keep on top of even though I panicked after the exams :P</P>

<H4>Project</H4>
<P>During second year every student had to create a fully functional system which could, theoretically, be implemented in a workplace. It also had to deal with files and be at least 1000 lines of C code long. I decided to do a Bar Stock Control system.

<H4>Systems Analysis and Design</H4>
<P>Systems analysis & design was a lot like Database in some areas. You had the data modeling and normalisation but you also had areas which were different. Areas that help you create a better computer system or program. This subject was very important when doing the project.</P>

<H4>Software Design</H4>
<P>Again probably the most important subject of the year. I thought after first year that we had learned all we need to know about C. How wrong was I. This year programs got a lot more difficult and things that we thought were complex and difficult last year we were expected to do constantly and without thought. A few assignments for this one.

</P>
<hr>
<p class="main">As well as the five main subjects those in the commercial stream did these additional subjects</p>

<H4>Commercial Programming</H4>
<P>Commercial programming was basically all about Visual Basic and how to create VB programs. I thought this subject was a lot more interesting than C and VB was a lot easier to learn. Maybe that has to do with already knowing C from first year. We also had a few assignments for this class and these programs are a lot more interesting than the C ones.

</P>

<H4>Multimedia</H4>
<P>A lot like information systems in first year however there was more emphasis on media preparation and how to create media presentations or applications. We had a big assignment for this which I did on how to play chess. It didn't come out exactly how I liked because I didn't spend enough time on it.
