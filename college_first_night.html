<H3 align="center">College / First Year (Certificate) / Nightlife</H3>
<P align="center" class="main">As I've said before, First year was highly enjoyable. Not least in the times that we were away from college altogether. Letterkenny is a great spot for going out. Many a Thursday night was spent out on the town or in a friend's house, drinking the rent money away. This is the story of the first year.</P>
<hr>
<P>As you can imagine first year in a new college can be quite daunting at first. It took us a while to get into the swing of things. The first few weeks were spent scoping the places out, seeing where the best craic could be found. A few of the pubs that were tried out during this period were McGinleys, The Cottage, and the Oasis. All very good pubs in Letterkenny. However one pub stood out among the rest for cheap beer and good music.  The Globe seemed to be the place that most people went to.</P>
<P>As the year went on, nights out became a more regular feature. The Globe was still packing them in and <A HREF="http://www.thepulseniteclub.com" TARGET="_blank">The Pulse Nightclub</A> was a regular stop every Thursday night. One very cool night was had in <A HREF="http://www.thegrillniteclub.com" target="_blank">The Grill Nightclub</A> on Halloween when top DJ's Judge Jules and Fergie played the night away. We had a party in the Celtic apartments beforehand and was the recovery place for many a hang-over afterwards. Class :)</P>
<P>The next big thing to happen was Rag Week (12/02/01 to 16/02/01). Every night there was something organised and most things were great. The Pulse again had the best business but Sister Sara's was a great place to be on Sunday and Tuesday nights. Thursday night in the Pulse was completely jammed. It was hell just trying to move in the place and this was with both upstairs and downstairs open. However it was still a great night out.</P>
<P>With the threat of exams looming and the funds running low, things quietened down after Rag Week. Although Thursday nights was still a regular night out, there just wasn't as much enthusiasm for it anymore. The Globe had the final of their Karaoke competition which was highly successful. A big congrats must go to Sonya McNally, Niall Kenny and Pauric Ward for getting into the final.</P>
<P>After the exams were over it was time for great celebration. There wasn't much talk on how people got on in their tests but there were very many goodbyes to be said. The Cottage bar was the bar of choice on this day and great craic was had in the conversations in the corner. Some were going to America for the summer, some were returning home and we knew some wouldn't be returning. However the last Thursday night at the Pulse was a great night with DJ Mr. Spring playin' upstairs. A great night that didn't finish until the wee hours. For Saturday I returned to the Celtic apartments to stay the weekend (having left my own accommodation). That day was a mixture of playing pool in the Globe while watching the Ireland V Portugal match and going to the Grill for one last knees-up before leaving Letterkenny until September.</P><hr>
