<h2><a href="sport_champlge.html">UEFA Champions League Current Season</a></h2>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match Day 13, Final</b><br>AC Milan show a brilliant display of football to go ahead 3 - 0 at half time. It looked like the gulf in class had finally caught up with Liverpool. The second half was a different proposition as AC folded and allowed Liverpool to draw level. 3 - 3 was the score after 90 minutes. Although AC had the better chances in extra time they couldn't find the net. The momentum was with Liverpool as AC were a spent force and they went on to win the penalty shoot out and become champions of Europe for the fifth time.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match Day 12, Semi Finals</b><br>Liverpool defy the odds and scrape a 1 - 0 win against Chelsea at Anfield. It was a contentious goal which I think wasn't over the line but the decision was final. AC Milan again don't impress against PSV when they lost 3 - 1 in Holland. They were four cracking goals and it was the AC away goal that clinched it for them. There were still some nervy minutes when PSV scored their third but it wasn't to be for them.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match Day 11, Semi Finals</b><br>AC Milan run out 2 - 0 winners against PSV Eindhoven. It wasn't a completely convincing win with a goal at the end of each half. PSV wasted many chances to get their away goal. Chelsea and Liverpool played out a 0 - 0 draw at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool managed to keep Chelsea out but never really looked like scoring. The second leg should be a better match.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match day 10, Quarter Finals</b><br>Bayern Munich left it too late to overhaul Chelsea's lead. They won 3 - 2 but it was a flattering score line as two late goals secured the win. If they had scored five minutes earlier then it might be a different result. Juventus didn't manage to score at home against Liverpool, in fact they hardly got a shot on goal. Liverpool defended well but it was the first leg that decided this match it ended 0 - 0.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match day 9, Quarter Finals</b><br>Chelsea beat an ineffectual Bayern Munich team 4 - 2 in London. They were long ball merchants all night and Munich did nothing about it. Only a late goal give them any hope for the next leg. Liverpool beat Juventus 2 - 1 at Anfield. Juve should beat them in Turin to go through.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match Day 8, Last 16</b><br>United did even less in the San Siro and were rightfully put out after losing 1 - 0. Arsenal were put out by Bayern Munich even though they won 1 - 0. Chelsea luckily beat Barcelona 4 - 2 even though Ronaldinho scored probably the best goal of the Champions League this year. Bayer Leverkusen rolled over against Liverpool again losing 1 - 3 so they went through.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match Day 7, Last 16</b><br>United played really bad and managed to lose 0 - 1 to AC Milan. They didn't seem to attack the whole match and they took off Ronaldo when he was the only player doing anything. Roy Carroll should take most of the blame though due to his huge error. Arsenal lost 3 - 1 to Bayern Munich but got that away goal which will probably see them through. The same could be said for Chelsea who lost 2 - 1 to Barcelona but from reports it seems that the goal they scored was against the run of play. The only team to do well was Liverpool who seemed to cruse passed Bayer Leverkusen 3 - 1. But there is that away goal.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match day 6</b><br>United finished the group stage with a 0 - 3 defeat to Fenerbah&ccedil;e which left them second in the group. It was a weak team they put out but it does mean we'll miss Real Madrid and Barcelona in the next round. Arsenal won 5 - 1 against a poor Rosenborg side while Chelsea were beaten by Porto 2 - 1. Liverpool were lucky that Olympiakos collapsed which allowed them to get the 3 - 1 score line they needed. Celtic, however, failed to get into the UEFA cup after a 0 - 0 draw with AC Milan at Parkhead. Their downfall was a 2 - 0 win for Shakhtar Donetsk over an under strength Barcelona.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match day 5</b><br>United ensured they would qualify to the next round with a 2 - 1 win over Lyon. It was a much improved performance. Arsenal drew 1 - 1 with PSV away from home and Chelsea drew 0 - 0 with PSG at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool need a good result from their final game after losing 1 - 0 to Monaco in France while Celtic keep their hopes alive with a well deserved 1 - 1 draw at the Nou Camp.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match day 4</b><br>United beat Sparta Prague at home 4 - 1 with four goals coming from vanNistlerooy. Celtic also won at home 1 - 0 to Shakhtar Donetsk, They are still unlikely to get through to the UEFA cup because of the results between the two teams. Arsenal could only draw with Panathinaikos at Highbury while Chelsea beat CSKA Moscow 0 - 1 all the way in Moscow. Liverpool beat Spanish side Deportivo by 0 - 2 in Spain.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match day 3</b><br>United could only manage a 0 - 0 draw away from home with Sparta Prague. What an abysmal match as well. Arsenal drew 2 - 2 with Panathinaikos away and Chelsea beat CSKA Moscow 2 - 0 at Stamford Bridge. Celtic continue their poor away form with a 3 - 0 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk. They'll need to beat them 4 - 0 at Celtic Park to be in with a chance of making the UEFA cup. Liverpool were held to a 0 - 0 draw with Deportivo at Anfield. All in all a crap week.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match day 2</b><br>Bit of a mixed week here. United won their match convincingly with a 6 - 2 win over Fenerbah&ccedil;e. Wayne Rooney got a hat-trick on his debut. The only bad point was the two soft goals conceded. Celtic lost to AC Milan 3 - 1 but they were two minutes away from getting a point. Two late goals flattered the Milan score line. Chelsea beat Porto and Arsenal drew away from home with Rosenborg. Liverpool lost 1 - 0 to Olympiakos. So I'm not too upset this week although the Celtic match was a bit of a kick in the teeth. I didn't expect them to win but to have the draw snatched away was cruel. In other news: Shelbourne lost 0 - 2 in Lille and are out of the UEFA cup.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Match day 1</b><br>Not a great first week in the Champions League. Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea all won while Celtic were beaten 3 - 1 by Henrik Larsson's new club, Barcelona. United didn't have such a good start either, they were 2 - 0 down to Lyon at half time and it didn't look good. They did sort of pull it together in the second half and Ruud vanNistlerooy pulled two back. 2 - 2 was a poor result against poor opposition but it could have been worse. As a side note Shelbourne are still in their UEFA Cup tie after drawing 2 - 2 with Lille. They now have to go to France and score to hopefully progress to the new group stage.</p>
