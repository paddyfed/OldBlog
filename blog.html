<p class="text">28/08/2005<br>I can't believe its been nearly a month since I've updated here. Madness. Not much has happened though. I am going to work with my Uncle in Belfast next Tuesday. It's not the area of computing that I'm most interested in but at least it's a bit of experience.<br><br>The PSP is being released here next Thursday so that's going to be a hectic day at work. There's been loads of pre-orders and I don't know where peope are getting the money to buy a console priced at &#8364;255. In other gaming news I've just completed the original Half-Life which really is a good game. It certainly kept me going for a while. Some of the puzzles were difficult but they didn't have you stupmed for too long. I'm now in the process of installing Half-Life 2. Hopefully it'll be just as good. I also bought Football Manager 2005 but I haven't played it that much. I started with Monaghan United and we won our first match 4 - 1 against Sligo Rovers.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">30/07/2005<br>Well what an interesting week. Last weekend we went out for a few pints on Saturday, just for a bit of craic. That was a good night although we didn't go mad in any way. I did go into work on Sunday severely hung over though. We did decide to go out for a few drinks on Sunday. Although we went out with the best intentions, it all went out the window when the Forum was mentioned. So we went out and I had the most drunken night I've had in a long time. The next morning, again at work, you couldn't talk to me for the hangover. It was all a bit of fun anyway. I'll be heading out tonight but at least I'm not working until Tuesday.<br><br>Just want to say good luck to a mate of mine Darren who headed off to England on Wednesday to look for work. I hope he has more success over there than he did over here.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">22/07/2005<br>So it's been two weeks since Oxegen and I've just about recovered from the severe sun burn that I got. The weather was brilliant on the Saturday and Sunday. In fact it was too good. I have to say that Green Day rocked the whole weekend. They were by far the best band there and they really put on a good show. Other worthy mentions go to Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs. Of course The Killers and The Foo Fighters were great too. It was just a brilliant weekend.<br><br>Got some new games recently. I've just this minute finished Star Wars Republic Commando which wasn't too bad. The enemy AI wasn't great but the tougher droids could be annoying sometimes. There's one bit near the end with a spider droid that had me in knots trying to complete it. I've also got Half-Life 2 and God of War on the PS2. I haven't played Half-Life and I've only had a short go on God of War but it seems good so far. I also got Advance Wars for the GBA and it seems like an addictive wee game. I'd love to play it with two or more players though.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">20/06/2005<br>Well I haven't updated in a long time because I've been kind of busy. Plus I really didn't want to write about Liverpool and the FA cup final cause it's still hard to swallow. Anyway onto better things.<br><br>Episode III was just unbelievable! we went to see it twice on the 19th as planned and the screen was absolutely huge. There wasn't much of a crowd when we went to see it the first time either so it was nice and relaxed in the cinema, even though my stomach was up in knots. It was one of those moments where you couldn't believe it was actually happening. We managed to watch all of the other movies back to back and in order of release the night before. It took a long time, I don't think we were finished until about half two in the morning. I didn't manage to watch the Clone Wars cartoons but I don't think it really mattered in the end.<br><br>What else has happened? We've just come back from a great weekend in the Isle of Mann. We went over for my two nephews confirmation and we had an action packed time. We got to see some of the sites of the island on Saturday when we went to the Laxey Wheel on the electric tram and we had a great day at Onchan Pleasure Park on Sunday before we had to leave.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">08/05/2005<br>Just 11 days until Episode III and this may be my last post until I've seen the film. That's why we've gone all Episode III in the scheme of the site. I think it looks pretty cool. As it turns out I'm not working next Sunday so I'll be able to relax at home before getting the bus down. It's going to be class.<br><br>I've bought a few new games recently. I finally went out and bought Half-Life to see what all the fuss was about. It does seem like a good game so far with lots of jump out of your seat moments but I'll reserve judgment for now. Sim City 4 seems like a cool game. I used to play Sim City 2000 but this version is a lot different and will take some getting used to. World Championship Snooker 2005 is a good game too. We've been playing the 2004 version at work for the last few weeks and this is just a step up from it. You can't make those impossible shots anymore so positioning is all the more important. I haven't played Starcraft yet although I used to have a demo of it years ago and it looked promising.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">01/05/2005<br>Well it's the first of May and this year is flying so far. That means there's only 18 days until Episode III is released. It's going to be a bit hectic coming up to the 19th cause I'll be working the Sunday beforehand so I'll probably have to get the bus straight from work. I haven't decided yet though.<br><br>I just finished Grand Theft Auto III on Thursday. It didn't take me too long to finish it but I haven't completed all the side missions or found even a quarter of the hidden packages. Now it's on to Vice City.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">20/04/2005<br>Just a month left until Episode III and we've got our tickets already. We're going to see it at 12 O'Clock (midday) at UGC in Dublin on the 19th and again at 6:15 that evening. Can't wait especially after watching the new clone wars cartoons. They didn't have the same impact as the first ones but I suppose that's to be expected. I hope to bring them down to Dublin with me and watch them before seeing Episode III.<br><br>I got a pre-owned copy of Grand Theft Auto III on PS2, it was a perfect disk and that's why I got it. You forget just how good a game it is.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">16/03/2005<br>Wow. I've been watching the new trailer for Episode III and all I can say is wow. It looks fantastic, Anakin is finally the bad ass that he should be. The Clone Wars season 3 will be starting soon too. I've been downloading a few of the trailers for that and it seems to be action packed too. I'll have to look back and see where I downloaded the last two seasons and see if they'll be giving links to season 3. If not then It'll be very difficult for me to see them and I really want to before Episode III comes out.<br><br>So Ireland's bid to win the Grand Slam is over. They never played well against France, especially in the first half, and so deserved not to win. It does sicken me that Wales will probably win the championship now though. I'd say Ireland will have to wait another two years to get as good a chance and who knows what situation they'll be in then.<br><br>The 21st at the weekend was great. Although I was exhausted after work on Friday we still had a good time in the club. The next day we went to watch the rugby in town and that lasted until the wee hours of the morning, drinking in the Lakeside's Resident's bar. I'm heading up to Letterkenny for Paddy's day for another day's drinking.<br><br>I got my Nintendo DS on Friday, it's a cool piece of kit but I'm a bit worried at the lack of games at the minute. I did get Pok&eacute;mon Leaf Green though, that should tide me over. That day at work was a bit crazy. I don't think I'd ever been as stressed out, not even on the first PS2 day!</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">05/03/2005<br>So it's been a month since I've updated which is bad cause now I can't really remember all that's happened since. I did get my new graphics card and I'm really pleased with it cause the Sims 2 and Medal of Honor work really well under it.<br><br>I'm getting a week off from work the week after next which includes Paddy's day so I think I'll be goin out that night.<br><br>There's an 18th that I'm going to tonight which should be good craic. I haven't been out since the 21st that I was at three weeks ago which was all right. Having no work tomorrow helps though. There's also another 21st next weekend and a good friend of mine is coming down from Donegal to go to it. That should be mental craic cause there's always a good night when I'm out with him.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">05/02/2005<br>There's nearly 100 days left until Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is released. The 19th of May has been confirmed as the release date in the UK which I suppose means Ireland as well. I still don't know what to do for the release. I don't want to see it in my local cinema because, basically, it's crap. I would love to go over to a premiere in London maybe but it's organising the trip that I couldn't be bothered with. I'll have to do something for the last Star Wars movie to be released though!<br><br>I'm going to get a new graphics card for the PC, an ATI Radeon 9800. I know it's probably not the best graphics card on the market but it's within my budget and it's better than my current Hercules 3D Prophet.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">30/01/2005<br>So there's only 50 days left until Clone Wars season 3 is released, that means I need to get my finger out and see about getting Hyperspace back. I'm going to get my own credit card so that I can get books and things online by myself but I need to get a passport or some method of identification first. So that's m next task but it's gonna cost me at least &#8364;75 to get a passport. It'll be worth it though to get the Clone Wars season 3 and maybe a proper host for this site.<br><br>By the way happy <a href="http://www.winter-een-mas.com">Winter-een-mas</a> to you all. I bought The Sims 2 but I haven't played it that much yet. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas still takes up most of my gaming time.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">23/01/2005<br>I've finally done it! After three and a half years (exactly) I've left Club Mexx at the Four Seasons Hotel. My last night working was last Saturday night and it was a bit strange. I only really thought about it being my last night when people reminded me. Then I had a huge smile on my face because I knew that Saturday nights will be my own from now on. I will miss the craic though, the abuse and the work I wont. From now on it's just GAME that I'll be working in.<br><br>So another Christmas is over us. Not much happened that was very exciting but we all had a good time. It was my sister's 21st and 18th birthday party which was the only time that I really went out, the other time being the GAME staff party. I got absolutely loaded at the party though. I can't really remember much about the house afterwards. Still it was a good night.<br><br>My friend Vinnie has just come back from America sporting a brand new Nintendo DS and I have to say I'm very impressed. I may just get one when they're finally released here. I already have a PS2 so I don't think I'll be getting a PSP.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">13/12/2004<br>Yea I know the updates are starting to lag but that's what you get for having two jobs and no free time. I'll be leaving Club Mexx soon though (sometime in the new year) so I should have more free time then. I don't know if I'll get this web site finished in time though. It's supposed to be done before Christmas but it'll be tight. I am missing a lot of information though so I do have an excuse.<br><br>I've downloaded Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird as a replacement for the Mozilla browser that I had. Although I had a few problems configuring Thunderbird, it seems to be going all right now.<br><br>The Clone Wars DVD is officially being released on the 22nd of March next year, the day after Season 3 airs, so that's something to look forward to.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">19/11/2004<br>Wow it's been a while since I updated here. That's what you get for getting a job and having no spare time. So what's been happening since? Well I splashed out and bought myself a Playstation 2 (one of the new thin ones) just so I could play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It's some game too, I'm not even half way through it yet and already it feels bigger than any other game I've ever played. I also got Fifa 2005 which seems good but I haven't played it that much and I bought a pre-owned Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 for &#8364;15, bargain or what!<br><br>I've also downloaded the trailer for Star Wars Episode III and it looks the business! I can't wait for more trailers and things to come out. I'll soon have to renew my Hyperspace account, I got it for Christmas last year so I assume that they'll notify me about it soon enough.<br><br>South Park episodes are back again and it's handy enough for me to go down town and download them, I would seriously love to get Broadband Internet at home but damn that whole distance thing!<br><br>I'm going to a 21st tonight which will be the first time that I've been out since Graduation. A good friend of mine, Skinny, is coming home from Scotland to have his party in Monaghan so it'll be good to get the old Mexx gang together again.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">28/10/2004<br>I think I've watched most of the extras on the Star Wars DVD's by this stage. There's still a few documentaries that I have to look at so whenever I get a bit of spare time. South Park is about to start again so new downloads should be forthcoming. I think I'll download them in this place in town that has broadband access and allows you to burn CD's. I should be able to do that during my lunch break at work. That's going well too, I'm actually getting to know the stock and don't need the manager to do everything for me. There's still a lot to learn though. GTA: San Andreas is released on Friday and I'm seriously thinking of getting a PS2 so that I can play it! I'll need to think about it a bit more though, they're a bit expensive like.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">22/10/2004<br>Working in GAME is getting better all the time. I can actually use the tills (mostly) and I'm getting to know how things work around there.<br><br>Graduation was great, it made me realise just how much I'm missing the craic in Letterkenny and how crap it is here in Monaghan. I went out about two or three times in Monaghan over the summer and that one Friday night after graduation was better than all of them combined. My sister said she noticed it too. I don't think I'll ever get that back which makes me sad. I have loads of photos though. Someday I'll put them up on the site (when I get a good host).<br><br>The Episode III Teaser Trailer will be released on the 4th of November and I can't wait. I have Hyperspace too so I should be able to see it on the first day! I also bought the Episode I and Episode II DVD's on Wednesday. I previously said that I wouldn't buy them until after Episode III but you never know what might happen after that. They might never be available in their original form again so better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">12/10/2004<br>So I've got a new job at GAME here in Monaghan. Cool stuff looking at computer games all day, talking to people about games, generally looking round the store like a headless chicken. It's still the awkward phase of the job, the part where you have to ask loads of questions in order to do anything useful. I think I'm gonna like it there, I just have to find me boots. So to honour this new job the site has gone all purple (that's one thing I like about the new design, it doesn't take much to change the color scheme).<br><br>Graduation is taking place this Friday and I can't wait. I've already got my suit and I'm going up on Thursday to get my gown and to go out for a few scoops. I'm determined not to get too drunk and be sick as a dog on Friday morning. I've yet to organise accommodation for the folks yet, doing that tomorrow.<br><br>Christopher Reeve died yesterday and it's a great loss. I loved the Superman movies  when I was younger and I guess I still do. We had taped versions of Superman II and Superman III and I used to watch them all the time. I'm gonna have to buy those DVD's now, Thanks for the memories.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">07/10/2004<br>Had an interview with GAME today (or is it yesterday now?) and it went well. I guess that was my first proper interview with proper questions like 'think of a time you used your initiative' or 'what motivates you' which you just have to bull on through. So I should be starting there soon (I hope) although I've had no official confirmation. The store itself will be opening on Saturday which is the same day that Ireland are playing France in the World Cup qualifiers! That should be a good match. Also that night we're all going to see Des Bishop at the Garage Theatre here in Monaghan. So I've finally got a night off work.<br><br>I've managed to download the newest Making of Episode III Webdoc (10) on the first go! I still haven't managed to download part 9 yet! It's a really good one too! Ah well, here goes attempt number 45.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">04/10/2004<br>So I've watched just about everything on the Star Wars trilogy DVD set and I have to say that I'm thoroughly impressed. Even the Rancor scene looks good. Also, listening to the commentary I now realise why George Lucas directed the three prequels. When he was making 'Return of the Jedi' the director Richard Marquand had great difficulty with all the special effects that were in the movie and George had to reassure him throughout. So rather than go through that again he decided to do it himself. It does mean that we don't have a director that can direct people that well but I guess it's up to the actors to make the most of it.<br><br>Still no word from GAME and I'm beginning to think that they didn't get my e-mail. I'll probably have to post off my CV tomorrow because it's looking likely that they'll open up within the next few weeks and I'd really like to get the job.<br><br>There's a new section which, originally enough, is called 'contact me' basically it's a page with my e-mail address on it but if you do e-mail me then I might post your message up to that page. That's if I deem it worthy to be on my site.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">27/09/2004<br>Woohoo! Got my Star Wars Trilogy DVD set on Friday! It cost &#8364;55 in Xtra-Vision which was all right, I was expecting it to be a bit more expensive than that. I haven't managed to go through it all yet but I have watched 'A New Hope' and 'The Empire Strikes Back' along with the Episode III preview and a few of the features. So I've yet to see 'Return of the Jedi' and the 'Empire of Dreams' feature. I love the changes that have been made as well. As my good friend Palps says, they only enhance the movie. There is still a lot of changes that can be made though. Some of the effects are still not great like Luke's saber on the Millennium Falcon and some of the TIE Fighter 'boxes' but they're only minor gripes. The change that most impressed me was the new Jabba in 'A New Hope', some were saying that it still looks rubbish but I was really impressed. It now actually looks as if Jabba is there and the stepping on tail 'joke' is a lot better. You can actually look at the scene now without cringing.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">20/09/2004<br>One day to go until the Star Wars Trilogy DVD is released. Even though I think it's out on Monday, I probably won't be able to get it until Tuesday or Wednesday when I might get a lift into town. Dunno where I'm gonna buy it yet though. I could try Tescos or Xtra-Vision, I suppose it'll depend which is cheaper and what condition the box is in. I've also been trying to download the latest Making of Episode III Webdoc but have been unsuccessful so far, but tonight it seems to be going a lot quicker so I'm hopeful!!!
<br><br>I might be creating a web site for Treanor Stone-Tec here in Monaghan. Nothing is certain yet but fingers crossed that I'll be able to create something to their liking. Updates as I get them.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">15/09/2004<br>Wouldn't you know it! As soon as I get the site up and running the host AnyXHost does a runner! Typical! Now I'll have to move back to ProHosting even though I hate the banners and pop-ups that they have. Unless I can find some other free site I think I'll soon have to think about actually paying for web space. I guess it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world; at least I could get some reliability and accountability if things go wrong.
<br><br>I just came back from Donegal again on Monday. I was up at Bird's 21st birthday bash which was pretty cool. I was as sick as a dog on Thursday though, I didn't move from the bed until late in the afternoon and that was after everyone else who I came up with went home. We went out again on Friday, Saturday and Sunday for pints. Bird's family are really groovy people and I think I got on well with them.
<br><br>So I guess I'll be looking for a job now. The thing is I'm not really sure what I'd like to do. I'd love to do web design but I don't know if there's much call for it nowadays, plus most people would be expected to know things like flash or JAVA which I either don't know or don't like doing. Oh well on to recruitireland.com and irishjobs.ie for me...</p><hr>
<p class="text">06/09/2004<br>Got my hair cut at last. I can't remember the last time I did get it cut. I have a feeling it was in May but I don't know if it was before or after the exams. Either way my hair was longer than it had been since I was in secondary school. But it's all gone now.
<br><br>Just came back from a week up in Donegal as well. I went up for the week just to have a bit of craic. I have to say that it was an excellent week. We started out in the Grill on Sunday then Sister Sara's on Tuesday and the Orchard on Wednesday. It was really good to get back to Letterkenny, so good in fact that I'll be going up next week too for a 21st. Sometimes it's easy to realise why you enjoyed college so much and weeks like that are the best example of it. God only knows if I'll ever get that anywhere else that I go.
<br><br>My computer is starting to act up a bit. It's not too bad at the moment but there is a strange noise coming out of somewhere and have yet to rule out the computer as a source. Also the Internet connection is slower than normal so I'm currently checking for spyware. On top of all that my nephew tried to install a game on the old computer and messed it up so that'll have to be fixed too. I guess that's what you get for going away for a week.</p><hr>
<p class="text">24/08/2004<br>Well this is the new site. Groovy isn't it? The old site was going a bit stale due to lack of regular updates so I decided to make an entirely new site design to revamp it. There should now be more regular updates on this site. Well, I say should 'cause you know what'll happen, after a while it'll just get too difficult to update and the site will go stale again. Anyway back to the blog. As you can imagine I haven't done much since college ended either in the looking for work area or the going on holiday venture. I'm still working in Club Mexx though which is exciting as ever. Well it's actually not that bad. The worst thing about it is the assholes that we sometimes have to deal with. In other stuff there's not much else happening. I think there's a plan to go away for a few days next week so that should be cool but nothing's confirmed yet. I've also found this cool online comic which is based on the first Monkey Island game and can be found <a href="http://www.worldofmi.com/features/comics/vink/">here</a>. Definitely check it out if you're a fan of the game.</p><hr>
