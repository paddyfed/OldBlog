<p class="text">04/03/2007<br>Didn't do a thing this weekend but we did get broadband in the flat on Wednesday so I'll be on <a href="http://paddy1138.bebo.com">Bebo</a> a bit more often. We also have been on XBOX Live a few times and it's quite good. I'd like to find my copy of Halo 2 though so I can try it online. Lost Planet just seems like a poor replacement even if it is a cool game. I must tryout Gears of War though. It's supposed to be good.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">26/02/2007<br>What a brilliant match. Ireland trounced England by 43 points to 13. As I said before I was out in Adam's house and we had a great day. We bought a few cans of Guinness to take out to the house with us and I don't think there were many left by the end. Without doubt that was the best performance I've seen by Ireland. They dominated in nearly all areas and this is against the 'mighty' England. Now on to Scotland for a Triple Crown?</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">23/02/2007<br>Went out to Cavan for a night out with Michael and it was a good one. Saw this class band in a pub before moving on to a night club. The club itself was nothing special but we did have a bit of craic before taking the scenic route home. Heading out to Adam's house on Saturday to watch Ireland play England in the rugby which should be a good match.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">17/02/2007<br>I'm trying to retrospectively add some blog posts here because I haven't updated in a while. If some of the facts turn out to be inaccurate then apologies on my part.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">12/02/2007<br>Went out with Brian for a days drinking on Saturday. We watched the Man Utd game in the POC before moving to McKennas to eat our Monty chips. We then met up back in McKennas where we sat in the corner drinking the night away.<br><br>Went home to watch the Ireland vs France Rugby game and what a disappointment. I thought we had it with the last penalty only for France to come down and score a try to win it.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">05/02/2007<br>On Friday after work we went out for a few drinks in the POC who were having their birthday party and pints were &#8364;2.80 so it was class. After meeting up with Michelle we went over to the Pig and met up with Pamela and Gerard and his sisters. We then went to the Forum and we all got very drunk and made fools of ourselves on the dance floor.<br><br>Was out in Adams house all weekend because it was Adams dads birthday. Adam and Michelle had bought him a Guinness fridge so we sat there drinking it all day whilst playing Guitar Hero and darts. On Sunday we watched Ireland beat Wales in Cardiff by a narrow margin although it was an exciting match. Also watched the Colts beat the Bears in the Superbowl that night. It wasn't a great match because of all the mistakes but the best team won in the end.<br><br>Got our phone in so now its time to look for a broadband package. Were going to get the same deal that we have at home which should cost us &#8364;20 a month each which is pretty cool.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">29/01/2007<br>On Friday a good mate Michael came down for a night out. I hadn't seen him since the Debs which was over six years ago so it was a nice surprise. We started off in the Pig and then moved onto the Tavern before finishing up in the Forum. Then it was back to the flat for more drunken Guitar Hero.<br><br>The next day Adam and Michelle were going to the Tavern for food so I tagged along. I then met up with Brian and Bird for an all day drinking session. We started in the Tavern where we watched the first half of Man Utd and Portsmouth in the FA Cup. We moved to the POC for the second half where we later met up with Landers who apparently had work to do earlier in the day. We then moved to the Pig where Adam, Pamela and Ashley were. We also met up with Lorraine, Ray, Aine and Bob. We just stood in the Pig all night drinking before Landers made his dive for the floor. I actually missed the event but I'm told it was dramatic.<br><br>Rang up about getting a phone line for the flat and it should be installed by the next two weeks.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">22/01/2007<br>Well it was Nikki's 21st last weekend and what an eventful night. The GAME crew met up in the Pig for a drink before getting a Taxi out to Nikki's house where she was having her party. We were all having a nice quiet night before Adam decided to show us how good he was on the Wii. Granted he beat me hands down on the bowling but when we moved onto the baseball disaster happened. On his very first swing the Wii controller hit the pint glass in his other hand and broke it, smashing it into tiny pieces. We all laughed but Adam wasn't too impressed. After the Rayman cake and food (including Pizza D'or pizza) we left for the Forum. It was a good night but I couldn't drink because I had to work the next day. Still good craic was had by all.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">15/01/2007<br>It was Adams 21st last weekend and we had a great time. First of all myself and Adam had a few cans in the flat on Friday night whilst playing Guitar Hero. The next day after playing a few games of darts on Warioware in the Wii Adam went for a meal in the West with his family. I met up with all of the GAME crew in the Tavern before going upstairs to meet up with Paul and Sinead. Later on Adam joined us and Brian and Landers came round for a few drinks. Then Nikki, Nicola, Emer and I went to the Shamrock to see Leona who was working that night. We had a few drinks (which turned out to be doubles) and then went back to the Tavern. We then went back to Michelle's house to play drunken Buzz. Later I found out that I was supposed to meet up with Brian and Landers in the flat but in my drunkenness I'd forgot all about it.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">08/01/2007<br>Went out on Saturday with two of my Sisters, Edel and Emma, cause it was a friend's birthday and she was heading off to Australia. We started off in the West on the third floor. It was good craic but the pints were terrible. Word of advice never get a pint up there. Go downstairs and bring it up, don't waste your money upstairs. Anyway we then moved on to the forum, staying on the second floor beside the bar. This is by far the best place to stand in the Forum because you're close to a bar that's never too busy and there's not too many people trying to get around you. After that we ended up back at Lynda's house for a few games of Twister. Class craic.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">01/01/2007<br>It's 2007! Didn't go out for New Years though because it's usually shite. Stayed at home and played Poker with Mum, Dad, Daniel and Ryan. It was good craic and I managed to win in the end. The only disappointing thing about staying home for new years is that there's no real excitement when the clock turns 12.<br><br>On Saturday night Landers, Adam, Gemma, Darren (who was back from England for Christmas) and Darren's sister Louise all went out for a few drinks. We met up in McKennas before going over to the Pig. There were a good few people out and I met up with a few guys who I hadn't seen in a long time. We then found the mythical free bus to take us to the Seasons (Or Lotus One as it's now known). There we just had a mad nights craic with much drunken dancing! Later Gemma, Darren and I went back to the flat to play the Wii and Gemma whipped us all on Wii Sports bowling.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">28/12/2006<br>Had an uneventful Christmas this year which seems to be the norm with other people you talk to. I spent it at home with all of our ones, even Edel managed to make an appearance after Becks and Emma went down to Dublin to get her. Later that night we had Ken over as usual for a few drinks and a nights worth of Poker. This year we didn't have the Trivial Pursuit out though.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">18/12/2006<br>Had our staff party last weekend for GAME and what a class night. We started off with a few drinks in the Pig and moved onto Jurells for our food. It was good food but the craic was better. We then went to the Tavern in the West and stayed there for most of the night. We all had a great laugh especially at Paul and Neil's attempts at dancing. There are some class photos of that night too. We then went to the Forum and although the nightclub was shite we all had a great time by staying together on the second floor just beside the bar. After the night was over we all made our way home but Neil, Adam and I stayed up for another few hours playing drunken Guitar Hero.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">11/09/2006<br>Was up in Letterkenny again for Bird's birthday. It was a good weekend. We started off in Voodoo (used to be the Mono) on Thursday night and got hammered drunk. Was so sick the next day too much to every ones amusement. That night we ended up in Voodoo again where I had to go back to Reynolds house to get another shirt because I wasn't allowed to have my Monaghan shirt on. We then went to McCaffreys where I haven't been in a long time and met up with Dave Kelly from college. We then spent the rest of the night in the grill and we surprisingly had a good night of it. The next night we started off in the Orchard and from what I remember we went to Milan but my memory's a bit hazy after that.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">31/07/2006<br>We went down to Dublin for the first time ever as a group and the occasion was that Landers knows someone who works in the Guinness storehouse. So we were invited down and we had a class weekend. We started off in the Porterhouse with it's fairy liquid pints of stout. We then moved onto a pub that I can't remember the name of but it was cool. There we met someone who was taller than Landers! It turned out to be a basketball player from Spain. We then made our way to the bastard child of a nightclub that was Copperface Jacks. The next day, after a good lie-in, we went to the storehouse and went on the tour. It was cool but the free pints were better. After that we went back to the flat had some food and went back into Temple Bar. After many pints there we went to the Pod or Crawdaddy's (still don't know the real name of the place). Now that was a night club and a half. Three different areas and three different styles of dance music. After that we just wandered the streets of Dublin till we found a taxi. We'll probably do it again someday so watch this space, and next time no shoes!</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">24/07/2006<br>So I've moved out of home at last. Moved into a flat with Adam in the middle of town. It's so handy for work and going out. Plus I won't have to wait on lifts anymore.<br><br>Went up to Letterkenny again with Mark. Brian was off for a few days and Bird was at home so we went up for a few nights of madness and birthday celebrations. We did start off in the Cottage (God I miss that pub) but I don't really remember the sequence of events. I do remember being in Milan and the Grill though but which days they were I'll probably never know.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">16/07/2006<br>Was out on Saturday for Leona's 19th. It was cool although the pints in the Camel were terrible. Try and avoid that place if at all possible.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">04/06/2006<br>Yesterday we went to Ballymena to my cousin's 21st/22nd Birthday party. What a great day it was too, there was a bouncy castle, loads of beer, great chat amongst the cousins and talk about fantastic weather. I did bring my camera but I'd forgotten about it during the day and so I've only a few photos none of which are worth putting up.<br><br>Got Half-Life 2: Episode One the other day, I don't think that its gonna be as good as Half-Life 2, it seems very slow to get going. Downloading a lot more stuff from the net these days too, loads of music and a few old cartoons and stuff. We only managed to get about 7GB worth of stuff downloaded in our first month.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">06/05/2006<br>Just got broadband today and it's going well. Already I've downloaded a few South Park episodes and a few film trailers. I'll need to be careful and not go over the limit even if it is generous (20GB).<br><br>I'm now looking forward to the new Superman movie. That was one of the trailers I downloaded and it looks cool. I'm actually glad that they seem to be carrying on the story from Superman I and Superman II I just hope it's not going to be too silly.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">05/05/2006<br>Bloomin fantastic! If you don't know what I'm so happy about then go here <a href="http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/release/video/news20060503.html">http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/release/video/news20060503.html</a> and rejoice!! Not only that but Lego Star Wars II is out on the same day. Roll on September!!!</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">29/04/2006<br><!--OK so a lot has gone on since the last time I updated here. The trouble is I can't remember a lot of it. What I do remember I'll try to put it on another page so that it doesn't block up the whole blog page. I'll call it the "<a href="duringthebreak.html">what happened during the break</a>" page.<br><br>-->So I've finally taken the plunge and joined that Bebo thing. I dunno if I'm gonna like it but I guess it can't do much harm. Hopefully this is where I'll be able to put up a load of photos for people to browse. That is until I decide to get my own web space that is.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">06/09/2005<br>So the PSP launch went well. It wasn't nearly as hectic as I thought it would be. I'm still not totally convinced that it's a must have machine. When GTA Liberty City Stories comes out though I may change my tune. We all went out on Saturday night as a farewell party to Gemma. We started off in McKennas then to the Pig for our meal then the Shamrock and finally the Westenra. It was a great night and now I can't wait until the staff party for Christmas.<br><br>I finished Medal of Honor Pacific Assault today too. It was okay but some of the areas were a bit too annoying to get through and your squad were pretty useless.<br><br>I bought a new phone last Monday, I wanted one that was going to last a bit longer than one phone call. It's a Nokia 3220 and it seems to be working so far.<br><br>The Episode III DVD will be released on the 1st of November which is the same day as Star Wars Battlefront II on the PS2. That'll be a good day then.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">28/08/2005<br>I can't believe its been nearly a month since I've updated here. Madness. Not much has happened though. I am going to work with my Uncle in Belfast next Tuesday. It's not the area of computing that I'm most interested in but at least it's a bit of experience.<br><br>The PSP is being released here next Thursday so that's going to be a hectic day at work. There's been loads of pre-orders and I don't know where people are getting the money to buy a console priced at &#8364;255. In other gaming news I've just completed the original Half-Life which really is a good game. It certainly kept me going for a while. Some of the puzzles were difficult but they didn't have you stumped for too long. I'm now in the process of installing Half-Life 2. Hopefully it'll be just as good. I also bought Football Manager 2005 but I haven't played it that much. I started with Monaghan United and we won our first match 4 - 1 against Sligo Rovers.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">30/07/2005<br>Well what an interesting week. Last weekend we went out for a few pints on Saturday, just for a bit of craic. That was a good night although we didn't go mad in any way. I did go into work on Sunday severely hung over though. We did decide to go out for a few drinks on Sunday. Although we went out with the best intentions, it all went out the window when the Forum was mentioned. So we went out and I had the most drunken night I've had in a long time. The next morning, again at work, you couldn't talk to me for the hangover. It was all a bit of fun anyway. I'll be heading out tonight but at least I'm not working until Tuesday.<br><br>Just want to say good luck to a mate of mine Darren who headed off to England on Wednesday to look for work. I hope he has more success over there than he did over here.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">22/07/2005<br>So it's been two weeks since Oxegen and I've just about recovered from the severe sun burn that I got. The weather was brilliant on the Saturday and Sunday. In fact it was too good. I have to say that Green Day rocked the whole weekend. They were by far the best band there and they really put on a good show. Other worthy mentions go to Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs. Of course The Killers and The Foo Fighters were great too. It was just a brilliant weekend.<br><br>Got some new games recently. I've just this minute finished Star Wars Republic Commando which wasn't too bad. The enemy AI wasn't great but the tougher droids could be annoying sometimes. There's one bit near the end with a spider droid that had me in knots trying to complete it. I've also got Half-Life 2 and God of War on the PS2. I haven't played Half-Life and I've only had a short go on God of War but it seems good so far. I also got Advance Wars for the GBA and it seems like an addictive wee game. I'd love to play it with two or more players though.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">20/06/2005<br>Well I haven't updated in a long time because I've been kind of busy. Plus I really didn't want to write about Liverpool and the FA cup final cause it's still hard to swallow. Anyway onto better things.<br><br>Episode III was just unbelievable! we went to see it twice on the 19th as planned and the screen was absolutely huge. There wasn't much of a crowd when we went to see it the first time either so it was nice and relaxed in the cinema, even though my stomach was up in knots. It was one of those moments where you couldn't believe it was actually happening. We managed to watch all of the other movies back to back and in order of release the night before. It took a long time, I don't think we were finished until about half two in the morning. I didn't manage to watch the Clone Wars cartoons but I don't think it really mattered in the end.<br><br>What else has happened? We've just come back from a great weekend in the Isle of Mann. We went over for my two nephews confirmation and we had an action packed time. We got to see some of the sites of the island on Saturday when we went to the Laxey Wheel on the electric tram and we had a great day at Onchan Pleasure Park on Sunday before we had to leave.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">08/05/2005<br>Just 11 days until Episode III and this may be my last post until I've seen the film. That's why we've gone all Episode III in the scheme of the site. I think it looks pretty cool. As it turns out I'm not working next Sunday so I'll be able to relax at home before getting the bus down. It's going to be class.<br><br>I've bought a few new games recently. I finally went out and bought Half-Life to see what all the fuss was about. It does seem like a good game so far with lots of jump out of your seat moments but I'll reserve judgment for now. Sim City 4 seems like a cool game. I used to play Sim City 2000 but this version is a lot different and will take some getting used to. World Championship Snooker 2005 is a good game too. We've been playing the 2004 version at work for the last few weeks and this is just a step up from it. You can't make those impossible shots anymore so positioning is all the more important. I haven't played Starcraft yet although I used to have a demo of it years ago and it looked promising.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">01/05/2005<br>Well it's the first of May and this year is flying so far. That means there's only 18 days until Episode III is released. It's going to be a bit hectic coming up to the 19th cause I'll be working the Sunday beforehand so I'll probably have to get the bus straight from work. I haven't decided yet though.<br><br>I just finished Grand Theft Auto III on Thursday. It didn't take me too long to finish it but I haven't completed all the side missions or found even a quarter of the hidden packages. Now it's on to Vice City.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">20/04/2005<br>Just a month left until Episode III and we've got our tickets already. We're going to see it at 12 O'Clock (midday) at UGC in Dublin on the 19th and again at 6:15 that evening. Can't wait especially after watching the new clone wars cartoons. They didn't have the same impact as the first ones but I suppose that's to be expected. I hope to bring them down to Dublin with me and watch them before seeing Episode III.<br><br>I got a pre-owned copy of Grand Theft Auto III on PS2, it was a perfect disk and that's why I got it. You forget just how good a game it is.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">16/03/2005<br>Wow. I've been watching the new trailer for Episode III and all I can say is wow. It looks fantastic, Anakin is finally the bad ass that he should be. The Clone Wars season 3 will be starting soon too. I've been downloading a few of the trailers for that and it seems to be action packed too. I'll have to look back and see where I downloaded the last two seasons and see if they'll be giving links to season 3. If not then It'll be very difficult for me to see them and I really want to before Episode III comes out.<br><br>So Ireland's bid to win the Grand Slam is over. They never played well against France, especially in the first half, and so deserved not to win. It does sicken me that Wales will probably win the championship now though. I'd say Ireland will have to wait another two years to get as good a chance and who knows what situation they'll be in then.<br><br>The 21st at the weekend was great. Although I was exhausted after work on Friday we still had a good time in the club. The next day we went to watch the rugby in town and that lasted until the wee hours of the morning, drinking in the Lakeside's Resident's bar. I'm heading up to Letterkenny for Paddy's day for another day's drinking.<br><br>I got my Nintendo DS on Friday, it's a cool piece of kit but I'm a bit worried at the lack of games at the minute. I did get Pok&eacute;mon Leaf Green though, that should tide me over. That day at work was a bit crazy. I don't think I'd ever been as stressed out, not even on the first PS2 day!</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">05/03/2005<br>So it's been a month since I've updated which is bad cause now I can't really remember all that's happened since. I did get my new graphics card and I'm really pleased with it cause the Sims 2 and Medal of Honor work really well under it.<br><br>I'm getting a week off from work the week after next which includes Paddy's day so I think I'll be goin out that night.<br><br>There's an 18th that I'm going to tonight which should be good craic. I haven't been out since the 21st that I was at three weeks ago which was all right. Having no work tomorrow helps though. There's also another 21st next weekend and a good friend of mine is coming down from Donegal to go to it. That should be mental craic cause there's always a good night when I'm out with him.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">05/02/2005<br>There's nearly 100 days left until Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is released. The 19th of May has been confirmed as the release date in the UK which I suppose means Ireland as well. I still don't know what to do for the release. I don't want to see it in my local cinema because, basically, it's crap. I would love to go over to a premiere in London maybe but it's organising the trip that I couldn't be bothered with. I'll have to do something for the last Star Wars movie to be released though!<br><br>I'm going to get a new graphics card for the PC, an ATI Radeon 9800. I know it's probably not the best graphics card on the market but it's within my budget and it's better than my current Hercules 3D Prophet.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">30/01/2005<br>So there's only 50 days left until Clone Wars season 3 is released, that means I need to get my finger out and see about getting Hyperspace back. I'm going to get my own credit card so that I can get books and things online by myself but I need to get a passport or some method of identification first. So that's my next task but it's gonna cost me at least &#8364;75 to get a passport. It'll be worth it though to get the Clone Wars season 3 and maybe a proper host for this site.<br><br>By the way happy <a href="http://www.winter-een-mas.com">Winter-een-mas</a> to you all. I bought The Sims 2 but I haven't played it that much yet. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas still takes up most of my gaming time.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">23/01/2005<br>I've finally done it! After three and a half years (exactly) I've left Club Mexx at the Four Seasons Hotel. My last night working was last Saturday night and it was a bit strange. I only really thought about it being my last night when people reminded me. Then I had a huge smile on my face because I knew that Saturday nights will be my own from now on. I will miss the craic though, the abuse and the work I wont. From now on it's just GAME that I'll be working in.<br><br>So another Christmas is over us. Not much happened that was very exciting but we all had a good time. It was my sister's 21st and 18th birthday party which was the only time that I really went out, the other time being the GAME staff party. I got absolutely loaded at the party though. I can't really remember much about the house afterwards. Still it was a good night.<br><br>My friend Vinnie has just come back from America sporting a brand new Nintendo DS and I have to say I'm very impressed. I may just get one when they're finally released here. I already have a PS2 so I don't think I'll be getting a PSP.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">13/12/2004<br>Yea I know the updates are starting to lag but that's what you get for having two jobs and no free time. I'll be leaving Club Mexx soon though (sometime in the new year) so I should have more free time then. I don't know if I'll get this web site finished in time though. It's supposed to be done before Christmas but it'll be tight. I am missing a lot of information though so I do have an excuse.<br><br>I've downloaded Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird as a replacement for the Mozilla browser that I had. Although I had a few problems configuring Thunderbird, it seems to be going all right now.<br><br>The Clone Wars DVD is officially being released on the 22nd of March next year, the day after Season 3 airs, so that's something to look forward to.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">19/11/2004<br>Wow it's been a while since I updated here. That's what you get for getting a job and having no spare time. So what's been happening since? Well I splashed out and bought myself a Playstation 2 (one of the new thin ones) just so I could play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It's some game too, I'm not even half way through it yet and already it feels bigger than any other game I've ever played. I also got Fifa 2005 which seems good but I haven't played it that much and I bought a pre-owned Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 for &#8364;15, bargain or what!<br><br>I've also downloaded the trailer for Star Wars Episode III and it looks the business! I can't wait for more trailers and things to come out. I'll soon have to renew my Hyperspace account, I got it for Christmas last year so I assume that they'll notify me about it soon enough.<br><br>South Park episodes are back again and it's handy enough for me to go down town and download them, I would seriously love to get Broadband Internet at home but damn that whole distance thing!<br><br>I'm going to a 21st tonight which will be the first time that I've been out since Graduation. A good friend of mine, Skinny, is coming home from Scotland to have his party in Monaghan so it'll be good to get the old Mexx gang together again.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">28/10/2004<br>I think I've watched most of the extras on the Star Wars DVD's by this stage. There's still a few documentaries that I have to look at so whenever I get a bit of spare time. South Park is about to start again so new downloads should be forthcoming. I think I'll download them in this place in town that has broadband access and allows you to burn CD's. I should be able to do that during my lunch break at work. That's going well too, I'm actually getting to know the stock and don't need the manager to do everything for me. There's still a lot to learn though. GTA: San Andreas is released on Friday and I'm seriously thinking of getting a PS2 so that I can play it! I'll need to think about it a bit more though, they're a bit expensive like.</p>

<p class="text">22/10/2004<br>Working in GAME is getting better all the time. I can actually use the tills (mostly) and I'm getting to know how things work around there.<br><br>Graduation was great, it made me realise just how much I'm missing the craic in Letterkenny and how crap it is here in Monaghan. I went out about two or three times in Monaghan over the summer and that one Friday night after graduation was better than all of them combined. My sister said she noticed it too. I don't think I'll ever get that back which makes me sad. I have loads of photos though. Someday I'll put them up on the site (when I get a good host).<br><br>The Episode III Teaser Trailer will be released on the 4th of November and I can't wait. I have Hyperspace too so I should be able to see it on the first day! I also bought the Episode I and Episode II DVD's on Wednesday. I previously said that I wouldn't buy them until after Episode III but you never know what might happen after that. They might never be available in their original form again so better to be safe than sorry.</p>

<p class="text">12/10/2004<br>So I've got a new job at GAME here in Monaghan. Cool stuff looking at computer games all day, talking to people about games, generally looking round the store like a headless chicken. It's still the awkward phase of the job, the part where you have to ask loads of questions in order to do anything useful. I think I'm gonna like it there, I just have to find me boots. So to honour this new job the site has gone all purple (that's one thing I like about the new design, it doesn't take much to change the color scheme).<br><br>Graduation is taking place this Friday and I can't wait. I've already got my suit and I'm going up on Thursday to get my gown and to go out for a few scoops. I'm determined not to get too drunk and be sick as a dog on Friday morning. I've yet to organise accommodation for the folks yet, doing that tomorrow.<br><br>Christopher Reeve died yesterday and it's a great loss. I loved the Superman movies  when I was younger and I guess I still do. We had taped versions of Superman II and Superman III and I used to watch them all the time. I'm gonna have to buy those DVD's now, Thanks for the memories.</p>

<p class="text">07/10/2004<br>Had an interview with GAME today (or is it yesterday now?) and it went well. I guess that was my first proper interview with proper questions like 'think of a time you used your initiative' or 'what motivates you' which you just have to bull on through. So I should be starting there soon (I hope) although I've had no official confirmation. The store itself will be opening on Saturday which is the same day that Ireland are playing France in the World Cup qualifiers! That should be a good match. Also that night we're all going to see Des Bishop at the Garage Theatre here in Monaghan. So I've finally got a night off work.<br><br>I've managed to download the newest Making of Episode III Webdoc (10) on the first go! I still haven't managed to download part 9 yet! It's a really good one too! Ah well, here goes attempt number 45.</p>

<p class="text">04/10/2004<br>So I've watched just about everything on the Star Wars trilogy DVD set and I have to say that I'm thoroughly impressed. Even the Rancor scene looks good. Also, listening to the commentary I now realise why George Lucas directed the three prequels. When he was making 'Return of the Jedi' the director Richard Marquand had great difficulty with all the special effects that were in the movie and George had to reassure him throughout. So rather than go through that again he decided to do it himself. It does mean that we don't have a director that can direct people that well but I guess it's up to the actors to make the most of it.<br><br>Still no word from GAME and I'm beginning to think that they didn't get my e-mail. I'll probably have to post off my CV tomorrow because it's looking likely that they'll open up within the next few weeks and I'd really like to get the job.<br><br>There's a new section which, originally enough, is called 'contact me' basically it's a page with my e-mail address on it but if you do e-mail me then I might post your message up to that page. That's if I deem it worthy to be on my site.</p>

<p class="text">27/09/2004<br>Woohoo! Got my Star Wars Trilogy DVD set on Friday! It cost &#8364;55 in Xtra-Vision which was all right, I was expecting it to be a bit more expensive than that. I haven't managed to go through it all yet but I have watched 'A New Hope' and 'The Empire Strikes Back' along with the Episode III preview and a few of the features. So I've yet to see 'Return of the Jedi' and the 'Empire of Dreams' feature. I love the changes that have been made as well. As my good friend Palps says, they only enhance the movie. There is still a lot of changes that can be made though. Some of the effects are still not great like Luke's saber on the Millennium Falcon and some of the TIE Fighter 'boxes' but they're only minor gripes. The change that most impressed me was the new Jabba in 'A New Hope', some were saying that it still looks rubbish but I was really impressed. It now actually looks as if Jabba is there and the stepping on tail 'joke' is a lot better. You can actually look at the scene now without cringing.</p>

<p class="text">20/09/2004<br>One day to go until the Star Wars Trilogy DVD is released. Even though I think it's out on Monday, I probably won't be able to get it until Tuesday or Wednesday when I might get a lift into town. Dunno where I'm gonna buy it yet though. I could try Tescos or Xtra-Vision, I suppose it'll depend which is cheaper and what condition the box is in. I've also been trying to download the latest Making of Episode III Webdoc but have been unsuccessful so far, but tonight it seems to be going a lot quicker so I'm hopeful!!!
<br><br>I might be creating a web site for Treanor Stone-Tec here in Monaghan. Nothing is certain yet but fingers crossed that I'll be able to create something to their liking. Updates as I get them.</p>

<p class="text">15/09/2004<br>Wouldn't you know it! As soon as I get the site up and running the host AnyXHost does a runner! Typical! Now I'll have to move back to ProHosting even though I hate the banners and pop-ups that they have. Unless I can find some other free site I think I'll soon have to think about actually paying for web space. I guess it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world; at least I could get some reliability and accountability if things go wrong.
<br><br>I just came back from Donegal again on Monday. I was up at Bird's 21st birthday bash which was pretty cool. I was as sick as a dog on Thursday though, I didn't move from the bed until late in the afternoon and that was after everyone else who I came up with went home. We went out again on Friday, Saturday and Sunday for pints. Bird's family are really groovy people and I think I got on well with them.
<br><br>So I guess I'll be looking for a job now. The thing is I'm not really sure what I'd like to do. I'd love to do web design but I don't know if there's much call for it nowadays, plus most people would be expected to know things like flash or JAVA which I either don't know or don't like doing. Oh well on to recruitireland.com and irishjobs.ie for me...</p><hr>
<p class="text">06/09/2004<br>Got my hair cut at last. I can't remember the last time I did get it cut. I have a feeling it was in May but I don't know if it was before or after the exams. Either way my hair was longer than it had been since I was in secondary school. But it's all gone now.
<br><br>Just came back from a week up in Donegal as well. I went up for the week just to have a bit of craic. I have to say that it was an excellent week. We started out in the Grill on Sunday then Sister Sara's on Tuesday and the Orchard on Wednesday. It was really good to get back to Letterkenny, so good in fact that I'll be going up next week too for a 21st. Sometimes it's easy to realise why you enjoyed college so much and weeks like that are the best example of it. God only knows if I'll ever get that anywhere else that I go.
<br><br>My computer is starting to act up a bit. It's not too bad at the moment but there is a strange noise coming out of somewhere and have yet to rule out the computer as a source. Also the Internet connection is slower than normal so I'm currently checking for spyware. On top of all that my nephew tried to install a game on the old computer and messed it up so that'll have to be fixed too. I guess that's what you get for going away for a week.</p><hr>
<p class="text">24/08/2004<br>Well this is the new site. Groovy isn't it? The old site was going a bit stale due to lack of regular updates so I decided to make an entirely new site design to revamp it. There should now be more regular updates on this site. Well, I say should 'cause you know what'll happen, after a while it'll just get too difficult to update and the site will go stale again. Anyway back to the blog. As you can imagine I haven't done much since college ended either in the looking for work area or the going on holiday venture. I'm still working in Club Mexx though which is exciting as ever. Well it's actually not that bad. The worst thing about it is the assholes that we sometimes have to deal with. In other stuff there's not much else happening. I think there's a plan to go away for a few days next week so that should be cool but nothing's confirmed yet. I've also found this cool online comic which is based on the first Monkey Island game and can be found <a href="http://www.worldofmi.com/features/comics/vink/">here</a>. Definitely check it out if you're a fan of the game.</p><hr>
