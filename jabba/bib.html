<P><B>Plot:</B><BR>To take over Jabba's Empire, to take over Rayloth

<P><B>Reason:</B><BR>Money, Power

<P><B>Co-Conspirators:</B><BR>B'ommar Monks, Nat Secura, other spies inside the palace

<P><B>Action Taken:</B><BR>When Bib Fortuna left his home world of Rayloth he vowed to come back and rule the Planet. He took an infant, Nat Secura, with him. Nat was the last surviving member of a clan on Rayloth and Bib knew that he would be helpful when he decided to return. He made his way to Jabba's palace on Tatooine and soon became Jabba's Major-domo or right-hand man.
<P><IMG SRC="bib_boushh.jpg" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" ALT="Bib Fortuna with the bounty hunter Boushh" ALIGN="LEFT">Bib was not happy with his situation. He longed to get rid of Jabba and take over his empire. He began conversing with the B'ommar monks in the palace and planned the demise of the Hutt. He constantly had to protect Nat from Jabba, even going as far as letting the monks remove Nat's brain and letting Jabba feed the now empty body to the Rancor.
<P>He searched the palace for secret passages and got security codes for many of the Hutt's accounts. When Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia came to the palace to free Han Solo, Bib advanced his plans to kill Jabba. He had originally planned to feed Jabba to the Rancor but Luke stopped that idea.
<P>He placed his personal speeder bike on the sail barge and went with Jabba to the Pit of Carkoon, taking with him a thermal detonator, which he would use to kill the Hutt and then return to take over the palace.

<P><B>Outcome:</B><IMG SRC="bib_palace.jpg" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" ALT="Bib Fortuna in Jabba's Palace" ALIGN="RIGHT"><BR>Bib never got the chance to use his Thermal detonator before Luke blew up the barge. Instead he left the barge on his speeder and made his way back to the palace, expecting to take over Jabba's empire as planned. When he got there, however, the B'ommar Monks were waiting for him.
<P>His brain was forcibly removed and placed in a nutrient jar. After a while he and Nat got brain walkers and began looking for cloning technology so that they may grow new bodies for themselves.

<P><B>My Opinion:</B><BR>Bib's plot, out of all the other plots in the palace, was the most likely to have worked. Bib showed great patience with his dealings with the Hutt and he could've waited a lot longer before making his move. It is only with the introduction of the Rebel Alliance heroes that he became reckless and lost some of his nerve.
<P>When this happened Bib Fortuna's plan was destined to fail.
