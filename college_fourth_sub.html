<h2>Fourth Year Subjects</h2>
<hr>
<p class="text">Fourth year was possibly the most entertaining year out of the four. We had fewer opportunities to be in the one room but this led to more time with our smaller class. Plus by this stage we knew each other so well that we could mess more and have more craic during practicals. This year we had seven subjects two of which were split into two and taught by two lecturers.</p>

<hr>

<H4>Advanced Database Systems</H4>
<p class="text">Quite a boring subject with loads of theory. There wasn't any notes to be taken down which was good but the exam was very difficult to study for and do. There was one seminar and one practical for this subject.
</P>

<H4>Comparative Programming</H4>
<p class="text">An easy enough subject to do as there was a good bit of programming and not a lot of theory to it. Some interesting things in it like JAVA Swing and Python as well as some of the more interesting theory parts. Two assignments one in JAVA and one in Python.</P>

<H4>Computer Science</H4>
<p class="text">Interesting enough and there were loads of notes to be taken. This is a subject that really makes you think and gave us a chance to communicate and work out problems as a class. No practical only one test.
</P>

<H4>HCI / Legal, Ethical and Social Issues</H4>
<p class="text">This was split into two subjects. Cyril Higgins took the HCI part and there were two practical for it one presentation and one report. The ethics part was taken by Evelyn Keown and there was one presentation and a number of reports to write. This really wasn't an interesting subject, all theory. Although some of the ethics parts were alright.</P>

<H4>Multimedia</H4>
<p class="text">An interesting subject that again was split into two. Simon McCabe took the more practical side of the subject with the Director project that we had to do while Mark Leeney took the more theoretical side.
</P>

<H4>Project</H4>
<p class="text">I found the project quite difficult not helped by the fact that I hardly went in to the class and only met up with my supervisor Liam Miller about twice or three times in the whole year. He was still groovy about it though and I managed to get most of the required documents and hand-ups in on time.</P>

<H4>Software Engineering</H4>
<p class="text">Without doubt the most boring subject this year. A real struggle to keep awake and it was often skipped especially in the evenings and the mornings and any time possible. Still there were a few reports to write and a group presentation which was an interesting endeavor.</P>
