<h1>Updates</h1>
<hr>
<p class="text">This is where all the updates to the site will be recorded. This started from the old web site that I had which was created on GeoCities. It was then moved to ProHosting.com after GeoCities stopped supporting FTP uploads this was at the start of 2002 I think. I then moved again to AnyXHost.com because they seem to be a good free hosting site with no ad banners or pop-ups. They did seem like a good hosting site although they decided to disappear on me so in September 2004 I moved back to ProHosting.com.</p>
