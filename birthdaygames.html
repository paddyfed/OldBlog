<h1>The Birthday Games</h1>
<hr>
<p class="text">The Birthday Games were started to give us something to do when it was my nephew Daniel's birthday. We had a party and afterwards we went outside to play these games. It was a great day and everyone had a great time which was a bit of a surprise to most of us. It was so successful that when it came to Ryan's birthday the following April we decided to do another Birthday Games which was shorter but just as enjoyable. So far there are no plans to do another games, the main reason being the difficulties in getting everyone organised. I'm sure someday we will do another games, I for one will look forward to it.</p>
