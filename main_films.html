<P ALIGN="CENTER" class="main">Apart from Star Wars these are my most favourite films and those films that I am looking forward to.</P>
<hr>
<H4>The Matrix</H4>
<H5>What it's about:</H5>
<P>Futuristic tale in which the world in which we inhabit is actually a computer program created to power super robots that control the earth. Neo, a computer hacker, is unplugged from the Matrix and becomes the one who will save the world.</P>
<H5>What I think:</H5>
<P>From the first five minutes of the film you are taken on a roller-coaster ride in which you're not sure which is real or not. Brilliant photography and moody atmosphere make this a classic.</P>
<H5>Favourite scene:</H5>
<P>Near the end when Neo fights Agent Smith. 'Your clip is empty'.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="#" onClick="window.open('pictures/film_matrix.jpg','pics2001','scrollbars');return false;"><IMG SRC="pictures/film_matrix.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="250" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" BORDER="1" alt="The Matrix"></A></P>

<hr>
<H4>Fight Club</H4>
<H5>What it's about:</H5>
<P>Twisted story about an insomniac and his new-found friend who create a secret fighting society which plans to bring the whole world down to the same level.</P>
<H5>What I think:</H5>
<P>What really makes this film is the twist in the tale near the end. I completely didn't see it coming and it hit me like a lightning bolt. Brilliant. You have to see it twice, although, to really appreciate the film.</P>
<H5>Favourite scene:</H5>
<P>The moment in the film that you realise the twist. Boom!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="#" onClick="window.open('pictures/film_fightclub.jpg','pics2001','scrollbars');return false;"><IMG SRC="pictures/film_fightclub.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="250" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" BORDER="1" alt="Fight Club"></A></P>

<hr>
<H4>Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels</H4>
<H5>What it's about:</H5>
<P>A group of East-end Londoners are being shafted by another group of East-end Londoners. So they steal hash from a third group of East-end Londoners and try to sell it back to a fourth group of East-end Londoners who originally owned the hash, all with hilarious consequences.</P>
<H5>What I think:</H5>
<P>A strange story that isn't actually that confusing to follow. Has some great scenes and some hilarious commentary and stories throughout.</P>
<H5>Favourite scene:</H5>
<P>Funniest moment was when the person came running out of the pub on fire and the lads just shrugged it off. A regular occurrence.</P>

<hr>
<H4>Snatch</H4>
<H5>What it's about:</H5>
<P>Many stories converge around the main plot of a Diamond theft gone wrong and a rigged boxing match with a bare-knuckle fighting Gypsy.</P>
<H5>What I think:</H5>
<P>A lot like Lock, Stock... but much-much better. Faster more clever and definitely one to see.</P>
<H5>Favourite scene:</H5>
<P>When the three guys went to rob Brick-Top's Bookies.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="#" onClick="window.open('pictures/film_snatch.jpg','pics2001','scrollbars');return false;"><IMG SRC="pictures/film_snatch.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="250" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" BORDER="1" alt="Snatch"></A></P>

<hr>
<H4>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</H4>
<H5>What it's about:</H5>
<P>Film interpretation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic in which a ring must be destroyed before it falls into the hands of the Dark Lord Sauron.</P>
<H5>What I think:</H5>
<P>WOW!!! Probably the best adaptation of The Lord of the Rings that you're likely to find. This is a brilliant movie & fans of the book shouldn't be disappointed.</P>
<H5>Favourite scene:</H5>
<P>At the very beginning, the story of the rings of power & the last alliance of Men & Elves.</P>
