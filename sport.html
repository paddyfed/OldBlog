<h1>Sport</h1>
<hr>
<p class="text">I don't really watch that much sport. I tend to concentrate on a few things like Formula 1 and Football rather than try to know everything about everything. Saying that I still would watch other sports like golf or tennis but I wouldn't get a big thrill out of them. In Formula 1 I follow Ferrari and Michael Schumacher and I have done so ever since he moved from Benetton. In football I would support Manchester United I guess, although I'm not very vocal about my support. I guess I'm a bit of a closet supporter. I hate Arsenal though and Liverpool and Chelsea. Internationally I support Ireland, of course, and I like to see Brazil win in the World Cup. In Rugby I would support any Irish team that's playing whether it be the Celtic League or the Heineken Cup and of course Ireland in the Six Nations. In Cricket I don't really mind who wins as long as it's not England, anybody but them.</p>
