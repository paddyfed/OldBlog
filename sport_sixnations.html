<p class="text"><b>Week 3</b><br>Ireland finally show some form by beating England at Croke Park. It was a brilliant controlling display by Ireland and they were thoroughly deserving the final score of 43 - 13. Italy surprised everyone by beating Scotland at Murryfield by 37 points to 17, their first away win. Finally France roll on as the only Grand Slam contenders by beating Wales 32 - 21.</p>

<p class="text"><b>Week 2</b><br>Ireland lose to France in Croke Park. They mostly played well, especially in the second half, and looked like winning when they were four points up with a minute left. However France came back up the field and scored the winning try with no time left on the clock. Final score was 17 - 20 to France. Scotland beat Wales 21 - 9 and England beat Italy 20 - 17 in the other matches.</p>
