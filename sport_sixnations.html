<p class="text"><b>Week 5</b><br>Ireland didn't even manage to win the Six Nations after being beaten by Wales in Cardiff 32 - 20, which means Wales have won the Grand Slam and deservedly so. England beat Scotland 43 - 22 to cap a disappointing series while France brought themselves into contention for the Six Nations win after beating Italy 13 - 56. It wasn't to be though and Italy get the wooden spoon..</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Week 4</b><br>Well that's it. Ireland have failed to win the Grand Slam after a poor showing against France in Landsdowne Road. The score was 19 - 26. England beat Italy in a nothing match by 39 - 7 and Scotland rolled over in the first half against Wales eventually losing 22 - 46.</p>

<p class="text"><b>Week 3</b><br>Ireland cap off a great start to the campaign by beating England in Landsdowne Road. Although some refereeing decisions were questioned Ireland deserved the win by 19 - 13. Scotland avoid the wooden spoon by beating Italy 18 - 10 and France lose their match to Wales 18 - 24 after failing to play in the second half.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Week 2</b><br>Ireland have a relatively convincing win over Scotland by 13 - 40. They didn't start well but finished off the game easily enough. Wales manage to trounce Italy in Rome by 9 - 38 and look like championship contenders. England manage to lose their match against France by 17 - 18 in Twickenham after some dreadful kicking.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text"><b>Week 1</b><br>Ireland don't get off to a convincing start with a 17 - 28 win against Italy in Rome. It was a good score line but they didn't play that well, especially in the first half. England lose out to Wales in Cardiff by 11 - 9 which was a good result for Wales. France don't get off to a great start either, only beating Scotland by 16 - 9 in Paris</p>
