<h1>Star Wars</h1>
<hr>
<p class="text">What can I say about Star Wars that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? I think it is, without a doubt, the greatest movie saga of all time ever. Not only is it exciting but it's mysterious, suspenseful, cool, dark, humorous, inspired, exciting (oh wait, I used that one already...well it's very important) and a whole lot of other things that make up these movies. Not only that but there's this whole other world to explore outside the movies. The Expanded Universe is the ever evolving ever expanding side to Star Wars. It covers everything from books to comics, games to toys and TV programs to radio plays. Some choose to ignore it but I love to immerse myself in it. And now, less than 250 days to Episode III being released, Star Wars is set to become bigger than ever.</p>
