<H3 align="center">College / First Year (Certificate) / College Life</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER" class="main">I'm sure you've all heard someone say that college isn't all parties and drink. Well that's very true. However college is also not all study and classes. For the majority of your time at college you are doing other things like shopping, hanging about with your mates or just messing around. This is what I enjoyed doing in my spare time.</P>
<hr>
<H4>Surfing the Net</H4>
<P>Like most people on the computer courses in LYIT, I tend to spend most of my time while out of class in the computer rooms of the college. Here you can do pretty much what you want (that is if the Technicians don't hassle you). Mainly done while between classes, surfing the net was dependant on the availability of computer rooms. My favourite sites to visit were: <A HREF="http://www.starwars.com" TARGET="_blank">www.starwars.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net" TARGET="_blank">www.theforce.net</A>, <A HREF="http://www.iol.ie/~starwars" TARGET="_blank">www.iol.ie/~starwars</A>, <A HREF="http://www.planetarion.com" TARGET="_blank">www.planetarion.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.newgrounds.com" TARGET="_blank">www.newgrounds.com</A> and <A HREF="http://www.galacticempire.net" TARGET="_blank">www.galacticempire.net</A>.</P>
<H4>Chatting in the Canteen/Coffee Dock</H4>
<P>During our lunch breaks we all congregated at the Canteen downstairs or the Coffee Dock upstairs. It was a chance to talk, have a cup of tea and get to know what happened in the Globe the previous night. More often than not a game of cards would be played. Killer 25 being my favourite. It was also something else to do when you've spent too much time in the labs.</P>
<H4>Resting at Home</H4>
<P>After a long hard slog at college, what better than to rest at home while watching your favourite (or perhaps your most despised) TV programme. For first year I lived in digs in Gortlee with eight other people so there was always some craic to be had. If not then it was the perfect opportunity to catch-up on events at home or to have some well earned sleep.</P>
<H4>Hanging out at a Friend's House</H4>
<P>If I wasn't at my own house or in the college I was usually hanging around town with my friends or in their houses. Most of my friends lived in their own rented house or flat so there were no restrictions on our comings or goings. Again this was an opportunity for chatting or watching TV. All-night card games were also an irregular feature, as well as parties.</P>
