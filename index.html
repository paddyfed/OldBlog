<h2><a href="blog.html">Blog</a></h2><hr>
<p class="text">04/03/2007<br>Didn't do a thing this weekend but we did get broadband in the flat on Wednesday so I'll be on <a href="http://paddy1138.bebo.com">Bebo</a> a bit more often. We also have been on XBOX Live a few times and it's quite good. I'd like to find my copy of Halo 2 though so I can try it online. Lost Planet just seems like a poor replacement even if it is a cool game. I must tryout Gears of War though. It's supposed to be good.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">26/02/2007<br>What a brilliant match. Ireland trounced England by 43 points to 13. As I said before I was out in Adam's house and we had a great day. We bought a few cans of Guinness to take out to the house with us and I don't think there were many left by the end. Without doubt that was the best performance I've seen by Ireland. They dominated in nearly all areas and this is against the 'mighty' England. Now on to Scotland for a Triple Crown?</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">23/02/2007<br>Went out to Cavan for a night out with Michael and it was a good one. Saw this class band in a pub before moving on to a night club. The club itself was nothing special but we did have a bit of craic before taking the scenic route home. Heading out to Adam's house on Saturday to watch Ireland play England in the rugby which should be a good match.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">17/02/2007<br>I'm trying to retrospectively add some blog posts here because I haven't updated in a while. If some of the facts turn out to be inaccurate then apologies on my part.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">12/02/2007<br>Went out with Brian for a days drinking on Saturday. We watched the Man Utd game in the POC before moving to McKennas to eat our Monty chips. We then met up back in McKennas where we sat in the corner drinking the night away.<br><br>Went home to watch the Ireland vs France Rugby game and what a disappointment. I thought we had it with the last penalty only for France to come down and score a try to win it.</p>

<p class="text">The original trilogy is being re-released in it's original format in September. It's going to be released at the same time as Lego Star Wars II so I'm looking forward to September then.</p>

<p class="text">Saw Episode III and it was fantastic.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">Bought the Episode I and Episode II DVD's to complete the set - so far.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">I got my copy of the Star Wars Trilogy DVD Box Set in Xtra-Vision on Friday. It's even cooler than I expected, it's like watching the films with fresh eyes again. It cost me &#8364;55 which I thought was reasonable.</p>
