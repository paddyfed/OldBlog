<h2><a href="blog.html">Blog</a></h2><hr>
<p class="text">28/08/2005<br>I can't believe its been nearly a month since I've updated here. Madness. Not much has happened though. I am going to work with my Uncle in Belfast next Tuesday. It's not the area of computing that I'm most interested in but at least it's a bit of experience.<br><br>The PSP is being released here next Thursday so that's going to be a hectic day at work. There's been loads of pre-orders and I don't know where peope are getting the money to buy a console priced at &#8364;255. In other gaming news I've just completed the original Half-Life which really is a good game. It certainly kept me going for a while. Some of the puzzles were difficult but they didn't have you stupmed for too long. I'm now in the process of installing Half-Life 2. Hopefully it'll be just as good. I also bought Football Manager 2005 but I haven't played it that much. I started with Monaghan United and we won our first match 4 - 1 against Sligo Rovers.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">30/07/2005<br>Well what an interesting week. Last weekend we went out for a few pints on Saturday, just for a bit of craic. That was a good night although we didn't go mad in any way. I did go into work on Sunday severely hung over though. We did decide to go out for a few drinks on Sunday. Although we went out with the best intentions, it all went out the window when the Forum was mentioned. So we went out and I had the most drunken night I've had in a long time. The next morning, again at work, you couldn't talk to me for the hangover. It was all a bit of fun anyway. I'll be heading out tonight but at least I'm not working until Tuesday.<br><br>Just want to say good luck to a mate of mine Darren who headed off to England on Wednesday to look for work. I hope he has more success over there than he did over here.</p>
<hr>
<p class="text">22/07/2005<br>So it's been two weeks since Oxegen and I've just about recovered from the severe sun burn that I got. The weather was brilliant on the Saturday and Sunday. In fact it was too good. I have to say that Green Day rocked the whole weekend. They were by far the best band there and they really put on a good show. Other worthy mentions go to Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs. Of course The Killers and The Foo Fighters were great too. It was just a brilliant weekend.<br><br>Got some new games recently. I've just this minute finished Star Wars Republic Commando which wasn't too bad. The enemy AI wasn't great but the tougher droids could be annoying sometimes. There's one bit near the end with a spider droid that had me in knots trying to complete it. I've also got Half-Life 2 and God of War on the PS2. I haven't played Half-Life and I've only had a short go on God of War but it seems good so far. I also got Advance Wars for the GBA and it seems like an addictive wee game. I'd love to play it with two or more players though.</p>
